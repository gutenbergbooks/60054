<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>EVOLUTION OF ROMANTIC LOVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Of all the rhetorical commonplaces in literature and conversation,
none is more frequently repeated than the assertion that Love, as
depicted in a thousand novels and poems every year, has existed
at all times, and in every country, immutable as the mountains
and the stars.</p>

<p class='c001'>Only a few months ago one of the leading German writers of
the period, Ernst Eckstein, wrote an essay in which he endeavoured
to prove that not only was Love as felt by the ancient Romans
the same as modern Love, but that it was identical with the
modern sentiment even in its minutest details and manifestations.
He based this bold inference on the fact that in Ovid’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ars Amoris</cite></span>
directions are given to the men regarding certain tricks of gallantry—such
as dusting the adored one’s seat at the circus, fanning her,
applauding her favourites, and drinking from the cup where it was
touched by her lips.</p>

<p class='c001'>Curious and interesting these hints are, no doubt. But a closer
examination of Roman literature and manners shows that Dr.
Eckstein has been guilty of the common blunder of generalising
from a single instance. Gallantry is one of the essential traits of
modern Love; and far from having been a common practice in
ancient Rome, the interest of Ovid’s remarks lies in the fact that
they give us the <em>first</em> instance on record of an attempt at gallant
behaviour on the part of the men; as will be shown in detail in
the chapter on Roman Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>And as with Gallantry, so with the other traits which make up
the group of emotions known to us as Love. We look for them in
vain among modern savages, in vain among the ancient civilised
nations. Romantic Love is a modern sentiment, less than a
thousand years old.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Conjugal Love is, indeed, often celebrated by Greek, Hebrew,
and other ancient writers, but regarding Romantic—or pre-matrimonial—Love
(which alone forms the theme of our novelists), they
are silent. The Bible takes no account of it, and although Greek
literature and mythology seem at first sight to abound in allusions
to it, critical analysis shows that the reference never is to Love as
we understand it. Greek Love, as will be shown hereafter, was a
peculiar mixture of friendship and passion, differing widely from
the modern sentiment of Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is because among the Romans the position of woman was
somewhat more elevated and modern than among the Greeks, that
we find in Roman literature a vague foreshadowing of <em>some</em> of the
elements of modern Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Dark Ages there is a relapse. The germs of Love could
not flourish in a period when women were kept in brutal subjection
by the men, and their minds refused all nourishment and refinement.
The Troubadours of Italy and France proved useful
champions of woman, as did the German Minnesingers, by teaching
the mediæval military man to look upon her with sentiments of
respect and adoration. Yet their conduct rarely harmonised with
their preaching; and the cause of Romantic Love gained little by
their poetic effusions, which were almost invariably addressed to
married women.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not till Dante’s <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Vita Nuova</cite></span> appeared was the gospel of modern
Love—the romantic adoration of a maiden by a youth—revealed for
the first time in definite language. Genius, however, is always in
advance of its age, <em>in emotions as well as in thoughts</em>; and the
feelings experienced by Dante were obviously not shared by his
contemporaries, who found them too subtle and sublimated for
their comprehension. And, in fact, they <em>were</em> too ethereal to quite
correspond with reality. The strings of Dante’s lyre were strung
too high, and touched by his magic hand, gave forth harmonic
overtones too celestial for mundane ears to hear.</p>

<p class='c001'>It remained for Shakspere to combine the idealism with the
realism of Love in proper proportions. The colours with which he
painted the passion and sentiment of modern Love are as fresh
and as true to life as on the day when they were first put on his
canvas. Like Dante, however, he was emotionally ahead of his
time, as an examination of contemporary literature in England and
elsewhere shows. But within the last two centuries Love has
gradually, if slowly, assumed among all educated people characteristics
which formerly it possessed only in the minds of a few
isolated men of genius.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Before we proceed to prove all these assertions in detail, it will
be well to cast a brief glance at the analogies to human Love
presented by cosmic, chemical, and vegetal phenomena; as well as
to distinguish Romantic Love from other forms of human and
animal affection. This will enable us to comprehend more clearly
what modern Love is, by making apparent what it is not.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>COSMIC ATTRACTION AND CHEMICAL AFFINITIES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It is a favourite device of poets to invest plants and even
inanimate objects with human thoughts and feelings. The
parched, withering flower, tormented by the pangs of thirst,
implores the passing cloud for a few drops of the vital fluid; and
the cloud, moved to pity at sight of the suffering beauty, sheds its
welcome, soothing tears.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And ’tis my faith, that every flower</div>
      <div class='line'>Enjoys the air it breathes.”—<span class='sc'>Wordsworth.</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The moon shines bright: in such a night as this,</div>
      <div class='line'>When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees,</div>
      <div class='line'>And they did make no noise.”</div>

      <div class='line'>“Purple the sails, and so perfumed that</div>
      <div class='line'>The winds were love-sick with them.”—<span class='sc'>Shakspere.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>One of the first authors who thus endowed non-human objects
with human feelings was the Greek philosopher Empedokles, who
flourished about twenty-three centuries ago. Just as the last of
the great German metaphysicians, Schopenhauer, believed that all
the forces of Nature—astronomic, chemical, biological, etc.—are
identical with the human Will, of which they represent different
stages of development or “objectivation,” so Empedokles insisted
that the two ruling passions of the human soul, Love and Hate,
are the two principles which pervade and rule the whole universe.
In the primitive condition of things, he taught, the four elements,
Earth, Water, Air, and Fire are mingled harmoniously, and Love
rules supreme. Then Hate intervenes and produces individual,
separate forms. Plants are developed, and after them animals, or
rather, at first, only single organs—detached eyes, arms, hands,
etc. Then Love reasserts its force and unites these separate organs
into complete animals. Strange monstrosities are the result of
some of these unions—animals of double sex, human heads on the
bodies of oxen, or horned heads on the bodies of men. These,
however, perish, while others, which are congruous and adapted
to their surroundings, survive and multiply.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Thus Empedokles, “the Greek Darwin,” was the originator of
a theory of evolution based on the alternate predominance of
cosmic Love and Hate; Love being the attractive, Hate the repulsive
force.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the preface to the first volume of <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>Don Quixote</cite></span>, Cervantes
refers those who wish to acquire some information concerning Love
to an Italian treatise by Judah Leo. The full title of the book,
which appeared in Rome in the sixteenth century, is <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Dialoghi di
amore, Composti da Leone Medico, di nazione Ebreo, e di poi
fatto cristiano</cite></span>. There are said to be three French translations of
it, but it was only after long searching that I succeeded in finding
a copy, at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. It proved to be a
strange medley of astrology, metaphysics, theology, classical erudition,
mythology, and mediæval science. Burton, in the chapter
on Love, in his <cite>Anatomy of Melancholy</cite>, quotes freely from this
work of Leo, whom he names as one of about twenty-five authors
who wrote treatises on Love in ancient and mediæval times.</p>

<p class='c001'>Like Empedokles, Leo identifies cosmic attraction with Love.
But he points out three degrees of Love—Natural, Sensible, and
Rational.</p>

<p class='c001'>By Natural Love he means those “sympathies” which attract a
stone to the earth, make rivers flow to the sea, keep the sun, moon,
and stars in their courses, etc. Burton (1652) agrees with Leo,
and asks quaintly, “How comes a loadstone to draw iron to it ...
the ground to covet showers, but for love? ... no stock,
no stone, that has not some feeling of love. ’Tis more
eminent in Plants, Hearbs, and is especially observed in vegetals;
as betwixt the Vine and Elm a great sympathy,” etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sensible” Love is that which prevails among animals. In it
Leo recognises the higher elements of delight in one another’s
company, and of attachment to a master.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Rational” Love, the third and highest class, is peculiar to
God, angels, and men.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the inclination to confound gravitation and other natural
forces with Love is not to be found among ancient and mediæval
authors alone. Paradoxical as it may seem, it is the “gross
materialist,” Dr. Ludwig Büchner, who exclaims rapturously: “For
it is love, in the form of <em>attraction</em>, which chains stone to stone,
earth to earth, star to star, and which holds together the mighty
edifice on which we stand, and on the surface of which, like
parasites, we carry on our existence, barely noticeable in the infinite
universe; and on which we shall continue to exist till that distant
period when its component parts will again be resolved into that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>primal chaos from which it laboriously severed itself millions of
years ago, and became a separate planet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Büchner carries on this anthropopathic process a step farther,
by including all the chemical affinities of atoms and molecules as
manifestations of love: “Just as man and woman attract one
another, so oxygen attracts hydrogen, and, in loving union with it,
forms water, that mighty omnipresent element, without which no
life nor thought would be possible.” And again: “Potassium
and phosphorus entertain such a violent passion for oxygen that
even under water they burn—<i>i.e.</i> unite themselves with the
beloved object.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Goethe’s novel, <cite>Elective Affinities</cite>, which was inspired by a late
and hopeless passion of its author, is based on this chemical notion
that no physical obstacle can separate two souls that are united by
an amorous affinity. But the practical outcome of his theory—that
the psychic affinity of two persons suffices to impress the
characteristics of both on the offspring of one of them—has nothing
to support it in medical experience; while the chemical analogy,
with all due deference to Goethe’s reputation as a man of science,
is against his view. His notion was that the children of two souls
loving one another will inherit their characteristics. But what
distinguishes a chemical compound (based on “affinity”) from a
mere physical mixture, is precisely the contrary fact that the compound
does not in any respect resemble the parental elements!
Read what a specialist says in Watts’s <cite>Dictionary of Chemistry</cite>:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Definite chemical compounds generally differ altogether in
physical properties from their components. Thus, with regard
to <em>colour</em>, yellow sulphur and gray mercury produce red cinnabar;
purple iodine and gray potassium yield colourless iodide of potassium.... The
<em>density</em> of a compound is very rarely an exact
mean between that of its constituents, being generally higher, and
in a few cases lower; and the <em>taste</em>, <em>smell</em>, <em>refracting power</em>, <em>fusibility</em>,
<em>volatility</em>, <em>conducting power for heat and electricity</em>, and
other physical properties, are not for the most part such as would
result from mere mixture of their constituents.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Chemical affinities, accordingly, cannot be used as analogies of
Love. Not even on account of the violent <em>individual preference</em>
shown by two elements for one another, for this apparently <em>individual</em>
preference is really only <em>generic</em>. A piece of phosphorus
will as readily unite with one cubic foot of oxygen as with
another; whereas it is the very essence of Love that it demands a
union with one particular <em>individual</em>, and no other.</p>

<p class='c001'>Equally unsatisfactory are all similar attempts to identify Love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>with gravitation or other forms of cosmic attraction. Here is
what a great expert in Love has to say on this subject: “The
attraction of love, I find,” writes Burns, “is in inverse proportion
to the attraction of the Newtonian philosophy. In the system of
Sir Isaac, the nearer objects are to one another, the stronger is the
attractive force. In my system, every milestone that marked
my progress from Clarinda awakened a keener pang of attachment
to her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>How beautifully, in other respects, does the law of gravitation
simulate the methods of Love! Does not the meteor which
passionately falls on this planet and digs a deep hole into it, show
its love in this manner, even as that affectionate bear who smashed
his master’s forehead in order to kill the fly on it? Does not the
avalanche which thunders down the mountain-side and buries a
whole forest and several villages, afford another touching illustration
of the love of attraction, or cosmic Love?—a crushing argument
in its favour? Or the frigid glacier, in its slower course,
does it not lacerate the sides of the valley, and strew about its
precious boulders, merely by way of illustrating the amorous effect
of gravitation? And millions of years hence, will not this same law
of attraction enable the sun to prove his ecstatic love for our earth
by swallowing her up and reducing her to her primitive chaotic
state? Imagine a man and a woman whose love consists in this,
that they must be kept widely separated by a hostile force to prevent
them from dashing together, and reducing each other to atoms
and molecules! <em>That</em> is the “love” of the stars and planets.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it is needless to continue this <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>reductio ad absurdum</i></span> of
pantheistic or panerotic vagaries. The method of the writers on
Love here quoted—Empedokles, Leo, Burton, Büchner—has been
to identify Love with cosmic force simply because they possess in
common the one quality of attraction, by virtue of which the large
earth hugs a small stone, and a large man a small maiden.
Modern scientific psychology objects to this (<i>i.e.</i> not the hugging,
but the method), because it does not in the least aid us in understanding
the nature of Love; and because it is as irrational to call
attraction Love as it would be to call a brick a house, a leaf a tree,
or a green daub a rainbow. For Love embraces every colour in
the spectrum of human emotion.</p>

<p class='c001'>Having failed to find a satisfactory solution of the mystery of
Love in the inorganic world, let us now see if the vegetable kingdom
offers no better analogies in its sexual phenomena.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>FLOWER LOVE AND BEAUTY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Until a few decades ago, it was the universal belief that flowers
had been specially created for man’s exclusive delight. This was
such an easy way, you know, to overcome the difficulty of explaining
the immense variety of forms and colours in the floral world;
and it was, above all, so flattering to man’s egregious vanity. But
one fine morning in May a German naturalist, Conrad Sprengel,
published a remarkable book in which he pointed out that flowers
owe their peculiar shape, colour, and fragrance to the visits of
insects. Not that the insects visit the flowers in order to shape
and paint and perfume them. On the contrary, they visit them for
the unæsthetic purpose of eating their pollen and their honey; while
the flowers’ scent and colour exist solely for the purpose of indicating
to winged insects at a distance where they can find a savoury lunch.</p>

<p class='c001'>But why should flowers take such pains to attract insects by
serving them with a breakfast of honey, and by hanging out big
petals to serve as coloured and perfumed signal-flags? Nature is
economical in the expenditure of energy; and as the production of
honey and large flowers costs the plant some of its vital energies,
we may be sure that this expenditure secures the plant some
superior advantage. Sprengel noticed that the insects, while
pillaging flowers of their honey, unwittingly brushed off with their
wings and feet some of the fertilising dust or pollen, and carried it
to the pistil or female part of a flower. But it remained for
Darwin to point out what advantage this transference of the
pollen secured to the flower. Darwin, says Sir John Lubbock,
“was the first clearly to perceive that the essential service which
insects perform to flowers consists not only in transferring the
pollen from the stamens to the pistil, but in transferring it from
the stamens of one flower to the pistil of another. Sprengel had
indeed observed in more than one instance that this was the case,
but he did not altogether appreciate the importance of the fact.
Mr. Darwin however, has not only made it clear from theoretical
considerations, but has also proved it, in a variety of cases, by
actual experiment. More recently Fritz Müller has even shown
that in some cases pollen, if placed on the stigma of the same
flower, has no more effect than so much inorganic dust; while, and
this is perhaps even more extraordinary, in others, the pollen
placed on the stigma of the same flower acted on it like poison”—a
curious analogy to the current belief that close intermarriage is
injurious to mankind.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>What Darwin and others have proved by their experiments is
that cross-fertilised flowers are more vigorous than those fertilised
with their own pollen, and have a more healthy and numerous
offspring. With this fact before us we need only apply the usual
evolutionary formula to account for the beauty of flowers. It is
well known that Nature rarely, if ever, produces two leaves or
plants that are exactly alike. There is also a natural tendency in
all parts of a plant except the leaves to develop other colours
besides green. Now any plant which, owing to chemical causes,
favourable position, etc., developed an unusually brilliant colour,
would be likely to attract the attention of a winged insect in search
of pollen-food. The insect, by alighting on a second flower soon
after, would fertilise it with the pollen of the first flower that
adhered to its limbs, thus securing to the plant the advantages of
cross-fertilisation. Thanks to the laws of heredity, this advantage
would be transmitted to the young plants, among which again
those most favoured would gain an advantage and a more numerous
offspring. And thus the gradual development not only of coloured
petals, but of scents and honey, can be accounted for.</p>

<p class='c001'>What makes this argument irresistible is the additional fact,
first pointed out by Darwin, that plants which are not visited by
insects, but are fertilised by the agency of the wind, are neither
adorned with beautifully-coloured flowers, nor provided with honey
or fragrance. And another most important fact: Darwin found
that flowers which depend on the wind for their fertilisation follow
the natural tendency of objects to a symmetrical form; whereas
the irregular flowers are always those fertilised by insects or birds.
This points to the conclusion that insects and birds are responsible
not only for the colours and fragrance of flowers, but also for the
shape of those that are most unique and fantastic. And this <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a
priori</i></span> inference is borne out by thousands of curious and most
fascinating observations described in the works of Darwin, Lubbock,
Müller, and many others. The briefest and clearest presentation
of the subject is in Lubbock’s <cite>Flowers, Fruits, and Leaves</cite>, which
no one interested in natural æsthetics should fail to read. There
is indeed no more interesting study in biology than the mutual
adaptation of flowers, bees, butterflies, humming-birds, etc.; for
just as these animals have modified the forms of flowers, so the
flowers have altered the shape of these animals.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many of the changes in the shapes of flowers are made not only
with a view to facilitate the visits of winged insects, but also for
keeping out creeping intruders, such as ants, which are very fond
of honey, but which, as they do not fly, would not aid the cause of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>cross-fertilisation. Of these contrivances, “the most frequent are
the interposition of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>chevaux de frise</i></span>, which ants cannot penetrate,
glutinous surfaces which they cannot traverse, slippery slopes
which they cannot climb, or barriers which close the way.”</p>

<p class='c001'>How obtuse are those who, with Ruskin and Emerson, accuse
science of destroying the poetry of nature! What poetry is there
in the thought that flowers were made for unæsthetic man, when
not one man in a thousand ever takes the trouble to examine one,
while for every single flower on which a human eye ever rests, a
million are born to blush unseen?</p>

<p class='c001'>But if we abandon the narrow anthropocentric point of view,
and admit that insects too have a right to live, how the scope of
Nature’s poetry widens! How easy it then becomes to share not
only Wordsworth’s belief that “every flower enjoys the air it
breathes,” but to endow it with a thousand thoughts and emotions
like our own—delight in a gaily-coloured floral envelope; hope
that yonder gaudy butterfly will be attracted by it; anxiety lest
that “horrid” ant may steal some of its honey; determination to
breathe the sweetest perfume on this darling honey bee, so as to
induce it to speedily call again.</p>

<p class='c001'>Love dramas, too, tragic and comic, are enacted in this world
of flowers and insects. Thus the Arum plant resorts to the following
stratagem to secure a messenger of love for carrying its
pollen to a distant female flower:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“The stigmas come to maturity first, and have lost the possibility
of fertilisation before the pollen is ripe. The pollen must
therefore be brought by insects, and this is effected by small flies,
which enter the leaf, either for the sake of honey or of shelter, and
which, moreover, when they have once entered the tube, are
imprisoned by the fringe of hairs. When the anthers ripen, the
pollen falls on to the flies, which, in their efforts to escape, get
thoroughly dusted with it. Then the fringe of hairs withers, and
the flies, thus set free, soon come out, and ere long carry the pollen
to another plant” (Lubbock).</p>

<p class='c001'>Then there are male flowers which go a-courting like any
amorous swain of a Sunday night. One of these belongs to the
Valisneria plant, concerning which the same writer observes that
“the female flowers are borne on long stalks, which reach to the
surface of the water, on which the flowers float. The male flowers,
on the contrary, have short, straight stalks, from which, when
mature, the pollen detaches itself, rises to the surface, and, floating
freely on it, is wafted about, so that it comes in contact with the
female flowers.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>But alas for the poor flowers! Few of them are thus privileged
to roam about and seek their own bride. Most flowers have no
more free choice in the selection of their spouse than an Oriental
or a French girl. There is no previous acquaintance, no courtship
before marriage, hence no Romantic Love, even if the undifferentiated
germs of nervous protoplasm in the plant were capable of
feeling such an emotion.</p>

<p class='c001'>Poor flowers! Their honeymoon is without pleasure, unconscious.
The wind may woo, the butterfly caress them—but the
wind has no thought of the flower, and the insect’s attachment is
mere “cupboard love.” The beauty of one flower cannot exist for
another which has no eyes to see it; its honey and its fragrance
are not for a floral lover’s delight, but for a gastronomic insect’s
epicurean use. No modest coyness, no harmless flirtation, no
gallant devotion and self-sacrifice, enter into the flower’s sexual
life; not even the bitter-sweet pangs of jealousy, for, as Heine has
ascertained, “the butterfly stops not to ask the flower, ‘Has any
one kissed thee before?’ nor does the flower ask, ‘Hast thou
already flitted about another?’”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus “flower-love,” with all its poetic analogies, has none of
the elements of Romantic Love. Even attraction fails, for plants
are commonly sessile, and cannot go forth to seek a mate.</p>

      <div class='line'>“I prayed the flowers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh, tell me, what is love?</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Two important lessons of this chapter should, however, be
carefully borne in mind; for though our search for Love has
so far yielded only negative results, some light has been thrown on
the general laws of Beauty in Nature. The lessons are:—</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) That there is in flowers a natural tendency towards Symmetry
of Form, all normal irregularities being due to the agency
of insects and birds.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) That the superior Beauty of one flower over another is due
to its superior vitality or Health, which, again, is promoted by
cross-fertilisation or intermarriage—the choosing of a mate not in
the same but in another flower-bed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Regarding the beauty of flowers a further detail may be added.
Some of the coloured lines on flowers are so placed as to guide the
visiting bees to the nectar or honey. More complicated colour-patterns
probably owe their existence to the advantage of having
an easy means of recognition at a distance. It is well known that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>bees on any single expedition visit the flowers of one species only.
Now it has been experimentally proved by Lubbock that bees
can distinguish different colours; and, if we may judge by analogy
with the human eye, they can distinguish colours at a greater
distance than forms. Hence the advantage to each flower of
having its own colours in its flag.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>IMPERSONAL AFFECTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>From the sexual life of plants we ought to pass on to that of
animals; but before doing so, it will be advisable to ascertain
clearly what is meant by Romantic Love, and how it differs from
other forms of affection, impersonal and personal; from the love for
inanimate objects and for plants and animals; from the family
affections—maternal, paternal, filial, brotherly, and sisterly love;
from friendship; and from conjugal love.</p>

<p class='c001'>Love is the most attractive word in the language, as Heine and
Oliver Wendell Holmes have remarked. Out of every half-dozen
novels one is likely to have the word Love in its title, as a bait
sure to catch readers. But whereas novelists always use this word
in the sense of Romantic or pre-matrimonial Love, in common
language it is vaguely used as a synonym for any kind of attachment,
from that of Romeo to the schoolgirl who “just <em>loves</em>
caramels.” For the verb <em>to love</em> there is perhaps no satisfactory
and equally comprehensive substitute; but in place of the noun
<em>love</em> it is advisable, at least in a scientific work, to use the word
Affection, which comprehends every form of love mentioned above.
In the present work Love, with a capital L, always means Romantic
Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>Professor Calderwood, in his <cite>Handbook of Moral Philosophy</cite>,
says that “Affection is inclination towards others, disposing us to
give from our own resources what may influence them either for
good or ill. In practical tendency, the Affections are the reverse
of the Desires. Desires absorb, Affections give out. Affections
presuppose a recognition of certain qualities in persons, and, in a
modified degree, in lower <em>sentient</em> beings, but <em>not in things</em>, for the
exercise of Affection presupposes in the object of it the possibility
either of harmony or antagonism of feeling.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In other words, the eminent Scotch moralist thinks we can
entertain affections only towards human beings, and, to some
degree, towards animals; but not towards plants or inanimate
objects. Careful analysis of our emotions, however, does not sustain
this distinction, which is as unpoetic as it is anthropocentric
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>and unscientific. Dr. Calderwood obviously confounds affection
with sympathy. Sympathy means literally to suffer with another,
or to share his feelings; and this, indeed, “presupposes in the
object of it the possibility either of harmony or antagonism of
feeling.” But affection, in his own words, “gives out,” and hence
can be bestowed, and <em>is</em> bestowed, by all emotional and refined
persons on a variety of “things,” that are neither sentient nor
even animate; and a poetic soul will even feel <em>sympathy</em> with such
a non-sentient thing as a crushed flower, for his imagination unconsciously
endows it with the requisite feeling.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Things” are of two kinds—those fashioned by man, and
those produced by Nature. A poem, a symphony, a violin, a
novel come under the first head; a tree, a precious metal, a
mountain under the second. An author who has passed through
the whole gamut of emotion in writing his book, follows its fate
with a paternal pride and an affectionate anxiety as great as if his
bodily child had been sent into the world to seek its fortune.
Perhaps the story of the German soldier who was carried off his
feet by a cannon-ball, and who grasped first his pipe and then his
severed leg, is not a legend. For was not his pipe, like a good,
friend, associated with all the pleasant hours of his life? An
artist certainly can entertain for his favourite instrument an
affection almost, if not quite, human in quality. When Ole Bull
suffered shipwreck on the Mississippi, he swam ashore, holding his
violin high above water, at the risk of his life. And to an
amateur who has often called upon his pianoforte to feed his
momentary mood with a nocturne or a scherzo, the instrument
soon assumes the functions of “a true friend, to whom,” as Bacon
would say, “you may impart griefs, joys, fears, hopes, suspicions,
counsels, and whatever lieth upon the heart to oppress it, in a
kind of civil shrift or confession.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As for “things” not produced by man, who that has ever
spent a summer in Switzerland is not quite willing to believe the
legend of the Swiss Heimweh—the exiled mountaineer’s reminiscent
longing and affection for his native haunts, which causes him
to die of a broken heart, even if wife and children accompany him
in his exile? His feelings are not identical with the æsthetic
admiration of a tourist; for these imply a certain degree of novelty
and artistic perception foreign to his mind. They are true
<em>impersonal affection</em>, for the snowy summits, sluggish glaciers,
azure lakes, chasing clouds coyly playing hide-and-seek with the
scenery below; the balmy breezes, and boisterous storm-winds;
the green slopes studded with cows, whose welcome chimes alone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>interrupt the sublime silence of the Alpine summits. For these
sounds and scenes are so interwoven with all his experiences,
thoughts, and associations, that he cannot live and be happy
without them in a foreign land.</p>

<p class='c001'>The attitude of an æsthetically-refined visitor is thus expressed
by Byron: “I live not in myself, but I become portion of that
around me; and to me high mountains are a feeling”—a poetic
anticipation of Schopenhauer’s doctrine, that for true æsthetic
enjoyment it is necessary that the percipient subject be completely
merged in the perceived object,—the personal man and the
impersonal mountain becoming one and indistinguishable.</p>

<p class='c001'>Like Romantic Love, the affection for the grander aspects of
Nature appears to be essentially a modern sentiment. The
Greeks, as has often been pointed out, had little regard for the
impersonal beauties of Nature; and to make the forests, brooks,
and mountains attractive to the popular mind the poets had to
people them with personal beauties; with nymphs and dryads and
goddesses.</p>

<p class='c001'>The latest phase of the modern passion for impersonal nature
includes even its most dismal and awe-inspiring aspects, with an
ecstatic predilection that would have seemed incomprehensible to
an ancient Greek. This phase has been thus beautifully described
by Ruskin: “There is a sense of the material beauty, both of
inanimate nature, the lower animals, and human beings, which in
the iridescence, colour-depth, and morbid (I use the word
deliberately) mystery and softness of it—with other qualities
indescribable by any single words, and only to be analysed by
extreme care—is found to the full only in five men that I know of
in modern times; namely, Rousseau, Shelley, Byron, Turner, and
myself, differing totally and in the entire group of us from the
delight in clear-struck beauty of Angelico and the Trecentisti, and
separated, much more singularly, from the cheerful joys of
Chaucer, Shakspere, and Scott, by its unaccountable <em>affection</em> for
‘Rokkes blok’ and other forms of terror and power, such as those
of the ice-oceans, which to Shakspere were only Alpine rheum;
and the Via Malas and Diabolic Bridges which Dante would have
condemned none but lost souls to climb or cross,—all this love of
impending mountains, coiled thunderclouds, and dangerous sea,
being joined in us with a sulky, almost ferine, love of retreat in
valleys of Charmettes, gulphs of Spezzia, ravines of Olympus, low
lodgings in Chelsea, and close brushwood at Coniston.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ruskin flatters himself if he still imagines he is the sole living
possessor of this feeling. Though there is much hypocrisy and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>guide-book-star-admiration among tourists, there are yet unquestionably
hundreds who enjoy the Via Malas, the ice-oceans and
solitary Swiss valleys they visit; and though their dismal delight
may not be so intense as Ruskin’s, it is yet sufficient to indicate
the growth of a general affection for impersonal nature in all her
moods, whether smiling or frowning.</p>

<p class='c001'>To a mind that can thus rise above human associations and
utilities, the sublimest thing in the world is the absolute solitude
of an Alpine summit. To the ignorant peasant the harsh cow-bell
which interrupts this silence is sweet music, because it
suggests the abodes of mankind; and on this primitive stage of
æsthetic culture Jeffrey placed himself when he wrote that, “It
is man, and man alone, that we see in the beauties of the earth
which he inhabits.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Inasmuch as mountain solitudes are accessible to only a very
small proportion of mankind, the existence of true impersonal
affection on a large scale can be more easily demonstrated by
recurring for a moment to the floral world. A city belle is apt to
look upon flowers merely from a social or military point of view;
the more bouquets, the more evidence of admiration and conquest.
of male hearts. And the city belle can hardly be blamed for this
callousness of feeling; for bunched flowers have lost as much of
their natural charm and grace as butterflies stuck up on rows of
pins in a museum. But watch that fair gardener in a suburban
cottage or a country seat; how she recognises every individual
plant, every single flower, as a friend for whose comfort she
provides with all the affectionate care which as a child she
lavished on her doll. If, after a refreshing shower, the flowers
hold up their heads and look bright and happy, her face reflects
the same feeling; if a drouth has parched them and dimmed their
lustre, she will neglect her own pleasures to bring them water,
and derive from this charitable action the same sympathetic
pleasure as if they had been so many suffering human beings.
And if an early frost kills all her floral friends, her sorrow and
despair will find vent in a flood of tears. What is all this but
affection—true affection—though flowers be but “things,” and
not “sentient beings.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Obviously Professor Calderwood erred in his definition of affection;
for, as the above analysis shows, when the regard for an
impersonal object rises to the fervour of adoring interest, it does
not specifically differ from personal affections any more than, for
example, maternal love differs from friendship. Unemotional
persons, who have had no opportunities to cultivate their love of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Nature, may feel inclined to doubt this; but they should remember
that just as there is an intellectual eminence (Shakspere, Kant,
Wagner) which the ignorant are too lazy or too weak to climb, so
there is an emotional horizon, beyond which those only can see
who have taken the trouble to ascend the summit whence a wider
scene is unfolded to the view.</p>

<p class='c001'>From one point of view, impersonal affections are even higher
and nobler than personal attachments. The evolution of emotions
has been but little studied, but so much is apparent—that there
has been a gradual development from utilitarian attachments to
those that are less utilitarian, or less obviously so. Personal
affections are too often exclusively selfish and based on material interests,
as the loss of “friends,” which commonly follows the loss of
wealth or position, shows. Whereas impersonal attachments are less
apt to be interested, selfish, and fickle, since they presuppose more
intellectual power, more imagination, more refinement.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, although it must be admitted that man is the crown
and compendium of Nature, uniting in himself most of the excellences
of the lower kingdoms with others exclusively his own; yet
it cannot be denied, either, that the vast majority of these
“crowns” of Nature are so full of flaws in workmanship, and
have lost so many of their jewels, that the sight of them is anything
but exhilarating. Indeed, it is obvious that the average
plant and the average animal are, <em>in their way</em>, far superior to the
average man, in beauty, health, vitality; natural selection, which
has been arrested in man, having made them so. No wonder,
then, that some of the greatest minds have turned away from
mankind, and devoted all their thoughts and energies to the
world of “things” and ideas.</p>

<p class='c001'>Goethe and other men of genius have often been accused of being
cold and unsympathetic, because they refused to shape their conduct
so as to please the people with whom they chanced to come into
contact. Had they wasted their affections and sympathies on their
commonplace admirers and acquaintances, instead of bestowing
them on art and science, on the great ideas that teemed in their
brains, we should now be without many of those glorious works
which could never have been created had not their authors ignored
personal relations for the time being, and bestowed all their
warmest impersonal affections on their ideas.</p>

<p class='c001'>As compared with men of genius, women have achieved but
little that can lay claim to immortal fame; and the principal
reason of this is that their affections are apt to be too exclusively
personal. A girl will assiduously practice on the piano as long as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>that will assist her in fascinating her suitors. But how many women,
outside the ranks of teachers, continue their practice after marriage,
from the <em>impersonal</em> love of music itself? Needless to say they
have no time; for every hour devoted to emotional refreshment
strengthens the nerves for two hours of extra labour.</p>

<p class='c001'>As regards the love of Nature, woman is, indeed, artificially
hampered. She may botanise to some extent, but she cannot, as
a rule, indulge in those solitary walks in a virgin forest which
alone can establish a deep communion with Nature. If accompanied
by friend, brother, husband, or lover, her thought will
inevitably retain a human tinge. No doubt there is something
comic in the ardent affection with which a German professor hugs
his pet theory regarding the Greek dative, or the origin of honey
in flowers, and in the ferocity with which he will defend it against
his best friends, if they happen to oppose it. But such complete
devotion to abstract crotchets is absolutely necessary to the discovery
of original ideas: and as women are rarely able or willing
to emerge from the haunts of personal emotion, this explains why
they have achieved greatness in hardly anything but novel-writing,
which is chiefly concerned with personal emotions.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>PERSONAL AFFECTIONS</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>I.—LOVE FOR ANIMALS</h3>

<p class='c013'>Over inanimate objects and plants we have this great emotional
advantage that we can love them, whereas they cannot love us,
nor even one another, though related by marriage, like flowers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Animals, however, can love both us and one another and be
loved; and this establishes a distinction between them and lower
beings, and a relationship with us, that warrants us in placing their
attachments under the head of Personal Affections.</p>

<p class='c001'>Calderwood is sufficiently liberal to admit that, to a degree
animals may be included in our affections. But Adolf Horwicz
who has written the most complete, and, on the whole, most satisfactory
analysis of the human feelings in existence, denies this.
“Love is and remains a personal feeling,” he asserts; it “can
only be referred to persons, not to things. The tenderness of
American ladies towards dogs and cats is simply a gross emotional
caricature.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So it is, very often, especially in the case of ladies who neglect
their children and make fashionable pets of animals, changing and
exchanging them with the fashion. But it is simply absurd to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>mention this case as a fair instance of human love towards animals.
How many of the greatest geniuses the world has produced have
become famous for their affectionate devotion to their dogs! “A
dog!” says an old English writer, “is the only thing on this
earth that loves you more than he loves himself.” And should we
be morally inferior to the dog—unable to love him in return?
especially when we remember that “histories,” as Pope remarks,
“are more full of examples of the fidelity of dogs than of friends.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Vischer, the well-known German writer on æsthetics, goes so
far as to admit that whenever he is in society his only wish is,
“Oh, if there was only a dog here!”</p>

<p class='c001'>There is something much nobler and deeper than sarcasm on
humanity in Byron’s famous epitaph on his dog:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“Near this spot</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Are deposited the remains of one</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Who possessed Beauty without Vanity,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Strength without Insolence,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Courage without Ferocity,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all the Virtues of man without his Vices.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I wonder if Horwicz could read the following exquisite prose
poem of Turgenieff without feeling ashamed of himself:—</p>

<p class='c001'>"We two are sitting in the room: my dog and I. A violent
storm is raging without.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The dog sits close before me—he gazes straight into my eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>"And I too gaze straight into his eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>"It seems as if he wished to say something to me. He is
dumb, has no words, does not understand himself; but I understand
him.</p>

<p class='c001'>"I understand that he and I are at this moment governed by
the same feeling, that there is not the slightest difference between
us. We are beings of the same kind. In each of us shines and
glows the same flame.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Death approaches, flapping his broad, cold, moist wings....</p>

<p class='c001'>"And all is ended.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Who then will establish the difference between the flames
which glowed within us two?</p>

<p class='c001'>"No! We who exchange those glances are not animal and
man.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Created alike are the two pairs of eyes that are fixed on each
other.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And each of these eye-pairs, that of the man as well as that
of the animal, expresses clearly and distinctly <em>an anxious craving
for mutual caresses</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>It is a vicious trait of the human character that it soon grows
callous to caresses, and that the unmasked expression of tender
emotion is regarded as undignified and in “bad form.” It is the
absence in the dog’s mind of this ugly human trait that makes him
such a delightful friend and companion. However much you
caress and fondle him, he will always be anxious and grateful for
the next gentle pat on the head, the next kind look, and will
never despise you for any excess of fond emotion lavished on him.</p>

<p class='c001'>The greatest flaw in Christian ethics is, that it takes so little
account of this capacity of animals for affection, and our duties
towards them. The duty of kindness towards animals is indeed,
as Mr. Lecky remarks, “the one form of humanity which appears
more prominently in the Old Testament than in the New.” “Thou
shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn,”
is a precept which deprecates even a very modified form of cruelty
to animals. Had this precept been given in a more generalised
and comprehensive form, what an incalculable amount of suffering
might have been saved the animals that had the misfortune to
be born in Christian countries, as compared with those in the
Oriental countries.</p>

<p class='c001'>According to Mr. Lecky, Plutarch was the first writer who
placed the duty of kindness to animals on purely moral grounds;
“and he urges that duty with an emphasis and detail to which no
adequate parallel can, I believe, be found in the Christian writings
for at least 1700 years.” Some of the earlier Greek philosophers
had based this duty on the doctrine of the transmigration of human
souls into animal bodies; and it is related that Pythagoras used
to buy of fishermen the whole contents of their nets, for the
pleasure of letting the fish go again. Leonardo da Vinci, from less
superstitious motives, used to buy caged birds for the same purpose;
and similar traits are told of other men of genius who were
sufficiently refined to recognise the evidences of emotion in animals.
In our times, finally, we have a man, Mr. Bergh, who devotes his
whole life to the object of establishing the personal rights of
animals to kind treatment on legal grounds.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, after all, the most influential friend animals have ever
possessed was Darwin, who, by establishing their relationship to
man on grounds which no one who understands the evidence can
question, for ever vindicated for them the privilege of personal
affection. The very grammar of our language has been affected
by Darwinism. Formerly, it was customary to write “the dog
<em>which</em> jumped into the water to save a child.” Now we say, “the
dog <em>who</em> jumped into the water.” In other words, animals are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>no longer regarded as “things,” or animated machines, but as
persons.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>II.—MATERNAL LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Within the range of impersonal emotions and affections, as we
have seen, women are vastly inferior to men; but in personal
affections—partly owing to their almost exclusive devotion to
them—women are commonly superior to men. Not always,
however; for, as we shall see later on, the prevalent dogma that
woman’s Romantic Love is deeper and more ardent than man’s is
an absurd myth. But in conjugal affection—which differs widely
from Romantic Love—woman is generally more sincere, devoted,
and self-sacrificing than man. In friendship, too, women are
more sincere and ardent than men; for friendship is an ancient,
rather than a modern sentiment; and as women are more conservative
than men, they have preserved this sentiment (at least
in early life), while among men it has become nearly extinct:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“All friendship is feigning, all loving mere folly.”—<span class='sc'>Shakspere.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But the one affection in which woman stands infinitely above
man is the maternal, compared with which paternal love is ordinarily
a mere shadow. Romantic Love in man and child-love in
woman are the two strongest passions which the human mind
entertains.</p>

<p class='c001'>In depth and strength these two passions are perhaps alike.
In point of antiquity, the maternal feeling has an advantage over
the Love-passion; for, of all personal affections, the maternal was
developed first, and the sentiment of Romantic Love last.</p>

<p class='c001'>Personal affections are of two kinds: (1) Those based on blood-relationship—maternal,
paternal, filial, brotherly, and sisterly
love; (2) Those not based on blood-relationship—friendship and
Romantic Love. Conjugal affection belongs psychologically to the
first class.</p>

<p class='c001'>That of all relationships the one between mother and child is
the most intimate is obvious. The child is part and parcel of the
mother: her own flesh and blood and soul; and in loving it the
mother practically loves a detached portion of herself—thus uniting
the force of selfish with that of altruistic emotion. This is the
primitive fountain of maternal affection. A second source of it
lies in the resemblance of the child to the father, reviving in the
mother’s memory the romantic days of pre-matrimonial Love. It
must be an unending source of interest in a mother’s mind to note
which of the child’s traits are derived from her, which from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>father. If she loves herself, and loves her husband, the child that
unites the traits of both must be doubly dear to her. The fact
that the child is inseparably associated with all the mother’s joys
and sorrows, from the wedding-day to death, constitutes a third
source of her attachment; and a fourth is the social regard and
honour which an energetic and gifted son, or a beautiful and accomplished
daughter, may reflect on her.</p>

<p class='c001'>The mother herself is of course unconscious of the complex
nature of her feeling and its origin; especially in the first days,
when the new feeling dawns upon her like a revelation. As in
the case of budding Love, the feeling is at first less individual than
generic—less the affection of this particular mother for this particular
child than the bursting out of the general feeling of motherhood,
inherited by her in common with all women.</p>

<p class='c001'>Natural selection helps us to explain how this general feeling
of motherhood was developed. As among animals, so among our
savage and semi-civilised ancestors, those mothers who fondly cared
for their infants naturally succeeded in rearing a larger and more
vigorous progeny than those mothers who neglected their children.
And through hereditary transmission this instinct gradually acquired,
that marvellous intensity and power which we now admire.</p>

<p class='c001'>The sublime and almost terrible height to which this emotion
can rise is most realistically depicted in Rubens’s famous picture in
Munich, representing the murder of the children at Bethlehem;
in which mothers grasp the naked daggers, and frantically expose
their breasts to receive the blows intended for their little ones.
Throughout the animal kingdom, including mankind, the female is
less pugnacious than the male, less provided with means of defence,
and hence more gentle and timid; yet in the moment of peril the
mother’s affection absolutely annihilates fear, and makes her face
danger and death with a courage, supernatural strength, and endurance,
rarely equalled by man, with all his weapons and natural
consciousness of superior muscle.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is in this blind, impetuous, passionate willingness of self-sacrifice
that maternal affection most closely resembles the passion
of Romantic Love.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>III.—PATERNAL LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>For paternal affection Natural Selection has done much less
than for maternal; and it is easy to understand why. For, useful
as the father’s assistance is in securing various advantages to the
growing child, yet even if he should cruelly abandon it altogether,
the maternal love would still remain interposed to save and rear it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Nor is it in the human race alone that paternal is weaker than
maternal love. Among mammals, as Horwicz remarks, we even
come across a Herr Papa occasionally who shows a great inclination to
dine on his progeny. And how irregularly the paternal—sometimes
even the maternal—instinct is displayed among savages is graphically
shown by this group of cases collected by Herbert Spencer:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“As among brutes the philoprogenitive instinct is occasionally
suppressed by the desire to kill, and even devour, their young
ones; so among primitive men this instinct is now and again overridden
by impulses temporarily excited. Thus, though attached
to their offspring, Australian mothers, when in danger, will sometimes
desert them; and if we may believe Angas, men have been
known to bait their hooks with the flesh of boys they have killed.
Thus, notwithstanding their marked parental affection, Fuegians
sell their children for slaves; thus, among the Chonos Indians, a
father, though doting on his boy, will kill him in a fit of anger
for an accidental offence. Everywhere among the lower races we
meet with like incongruities. Falkner, while describing the
paternal feelings of Patagonians as very strong, says they often
pawn and sell their wives and little ones to the Spaniards for
brandy. Speaking of the children of the Sound Indians, Bancroft
says they ‘sell or gamble them away.’ According to Simpson, the
Pi-Edes ‘barter their children to the Utes proper for a few trinkets
or bits of clothing.’ And of the Macusi, Schomburgk writes, ‘the
price of a child is the same as an Indian asks for his dog.’ This
seemingly heartless conduct to children often arises from the difficulty
experienced in rearing them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Some light is thrown on the genesis and composition of parental
affection by the three reasons named by Spencer, why among
savages and semi-civilised peoples in general sons were much more
appreciated than daughters. While daughters were little more
than an encumbrance to the parents, useless before puberty, and
lost to them after marriage, the sons could make themselves useful
in warding off the enemy, in avenging personal injuries, and in performing
the funeral rites for the benefit of departed ancestors.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a higher stage of civilisation it is probable that utilitarian
considerations of a somewhat different kind still formed a principal
ingredient in parental love. A son was valued as an assistant in
workshop or field, a daughter as a domestic drudge. Feelings of
a tenderer nature were of course sometimes present, but that they
were not general is shown by the fact, attested by numerous historic
examples, that the aim of our paternal ancestors in centuries
past was to make their children fear rather than love them.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>A slight element of fear is indeed necessary for the maintenance
of filial respect and discipline; but our forefathers were too prone
to sacrifice their tender feelings of sympathy with their offspring
to the gratification of parental authority, for the obvious reason
that the latter feeling was stronger than the former. The frequency
with which daughters especially were forced to sacrifice
their personal preferences in marriage to the ambitions and whims
of their father, affords the most striking instance of the former
embryonic state of parental affection.</p>

<p class='c001'>In modern parental love Pride is perhaps the most conspicuous
trait. This Pride has two aspects—one comic, one serious.
Nothing is more amusing than the suddenness with which the
“pride of authorship” converts a bachelor’s well-known horror of
babies into the young father’s fantastic worship. Yet though he
feels “like a little tin god on wheels,” he recognises the superior
rank of the young prince, spoils his best trousers in kneeling
before him, allows him to pull his moustache and whiskers, and,
indeed, shows a disposition towards self-sacrifice almost worthy of
a lover.</p>

<p class='c001'>The serious side of the matter reveals one of the greatest differences
between paternal and maternal love. A mother’s love is
largely influenced by pity; hence she is very apt to lavish her
fondest caresses on that child which happens to be imperfect in
some way—say a cripple—and therefore unhappy. The father on
the other hand, will show most favour to his handsomest daughter,
his most talented son; and nothing will so swell a father’s heart
and cause it to overflow with affection as the news of some great
distinction acquired by this son.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>IV.—FILIAL LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Spencer is doubtless right in asserting that of all family
affections filial love is the least developed; and in tracing this
weakness especially to the parental harshness and disposition to
inspire excessive fear just referred to. In Germany the example
of the Prussian king who so unmercifully treated his children was
extensively imitated. The condition in France is indicated by the
words of Chateaubriand: “My mother, my sister, and myself,
transformed into statues by my father’s presence, only recover
ourselves after he leaves the room;” and in England, in the
fifteenth century, says Wright, “Young ladies, even of great
families, were brought up not only strictly, but even tyrannically.”
And even two centuries later “children stood or knelt in trembling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>silence in the presence of their fathers and mothers, and might not
sit without permission.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Among animals filial affection can scarcely be said to exist,
except as a very utilitarian craving for protection and sustenance.
Among primitive men it is a common practice to abandon aged
parents to their fate. The parents do not resent this treatment;
and of the Nascopies Heriot even says that the aged father
“usually employed as his executioner the son who is most dear
to him.” Nor are cases of heartless neglect at all uncommon
even among modern civilised communities. But the gradual
change of fathers “from masters into friends” has tended to
multiply and intensify filial love at the same rate as paternal;
and the advance of moral refinement will tend to make the lot of
aged parents more and more pleasant, not only because the duty
of gratitude for favours received will be more vividly realised and
enforced by example, but because the cultivation of the imagination
intensifies sympathy, thus making it impossible for a son or
daughter to be happy while they know their parents to be unhappy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Our feelings are curiously complicated and subtly interwoven.
Parents feel a natural pride in their children. The best way
therefore to repay them for all their troubles is to act in such a
way as to justify and intensify that pride. On the other hand,
the thought that the parental pride is gratified also gratifies filial
vanity, and proves an additional incentive to ambitious effort.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>V.—BROTHERLY AND SISTERLY LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Young people of both sexes more frequently make confidants
and “bosom friends” of their playmates and classmates than of
their brothers and sisters. Why is this so? Novelty perhaps
has something to do with it. The domestic experiences and
emotions of two brothers or sisters are apt to be so much alike as
to become monotonous; whereas a member of another family may
initiate them into a fresh and fascinating sphere of emotion and a
novel way of looking at things. Moreover, friendship is very
capricious in its choice; and as the number of brothers and sisters
is limited, the selection is apt to be made in the wider field outside
the domestic circle. Again, it is a peculiarity of human nature to
appear in great <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>négligé</i></span> at home, and to regard the nearest relatives
as the best lightning-rods for disagreeable moods; and this does
not tend to deepen the love of brothers and sisters.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may be doubted whether this form of affection exists among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>animals or among primitive men; and even among civilised peoples
the bond is but a weak one, except in the most refined families.
Though brothers feel bound to protect their sisters, they reserve
most of their gallantry for some one else’s sister; and though a
sister will feel proud if her brother is one of a victorious crew, her
heart will beat twice as fast if it is her lover instead of her brother.
The English language has not even a collective word for the love
of brothers and sisters; and even the partial terms, “sisterly love”
and “brotherly love,” have more of an ecclesiastic than a domestic
flavour. The German language has a collective word—and a big
one too,—<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>Geschwisterliebe</em></span>; but it would perhaps be misleading to
infer from its existence and size that this species of family love is
more developed in Germany than in England. The German’s
advantage appears to be philological merely, and not sociological.
He is less of a traveller and colonist than the Englishman, who is
very often separated from his brothers and sisters for years. Yet
this sometimes is rather a gain than a loss; for it destroys that
excessive familiarity which, as just noted, makes friendship rarer
among members of the same hearth than between individuals of
different families.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the wider circles of blood-relationship—up to “forty-second
cousins”—the Germans pay much more regard than the English;
and the French perhaps go a step beyond the Germans. For in
France each family, with its ramifications, forms a sort of clique
into which an outsider can rarely enter. Needless to say that this
forms a great impediment to Love’s free choice.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VI.—FRIENDSHIP</h3>

<p class='c013'>If we now turn to the two remaining species of personal affection—Friendship
and Love—the emotional scenery undergoes a
great change. In all the cases so far considered, blood-relationship
was <em>a source of affection</em>; whereas in friendship it is commonly a
disadvantage, and in Romantic Love it is positively abhorred, except
in the more remote degrees. Some savage tribes, it is true,
allow, or even prescribe, marriages between brother and sister—especially
a younger sister; and cases occur of marriages between
father and daughter, mother and son. But civilised society—guided
by religious precepts, and possibly also by a vague instinctive
recognition of the advantages of cross-fertilisation—condemns
such unions as hideous crimes; and the mediæval theologians, in
their extreme zeal, forbade all marriages within the seventh degree
of relationship.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>In the case of friendship the objection to blood-relationship is
not founded on a social or religious precept; but it exists all the
same, as already noted. Perhaps Jean Paul’s maxim that friends
may have everything in common except their room accounts
for its existence. Brothers and sisters are commonly too much
alike in their thoughts and tastes to become friends, in the special
sense of the word. Hence it is that there is apt to be a deeper
attachment between those brothers and sisters who have frequently
been separated by school-terms than among those who are always
together. For in friendship, as in love, a short absence is advantageous.</p>

<p class='c001'>Friendship is partly an outgrowth of the social instinct and
partly a result of special associations, habit, community of interests
and tastes. As a boy I had an opportunity to make some interesting
observations on friendship among animals, showing that it
differed in degree only, and not in kind or origin, from that of man.
Among the animals we kept at our country-house were a dog, a pet
sheep, and some pigs. The dog showed his confidence in the
sheep’s amiable forbearance by abandoning his cold kennel on
winter nights and seeking warmer quarters by the side of his
woolly neighbour. For the pigs his friendly regards were shown
in a less utilitarian manner, by driving away, unbidden and untaught,
any swinish tramps that appeared, uninvited, to share their
meals. But the most peculiar relations existed between the sheep
and the pigs. In the absence of any other means of satisfying its
gregarious or social instincts, the sheep joined the pigs every
morning in their foraging expeditions in the woods, returning with
them in the evening. And, what was still more remarkable, when
after a time a dozen sheep were added to our stock of animals, the
old pet remained faithful to the pigs, and paid no attention whatever
to the newcomers. Here the friendly attachment, based on
habitual association and the memory of mutual pleasures of grazing,
was strong enough to overcome the inherited fellow-feeling for
members of its own species.</p>

<p class='c001'>Between this instance and those ordinary cases of companionship
among men which are called friendship, there is hardly any
difference. In the more intimate cases of special friendship the
craving for companionship is strengthened by a community of
thoughts and emotions. Bacon gives us in a nut-shell three of the
ingredients of friendship which are not to be found in the primitive
form just considered. The first is this, that each friend becomes
a sort of secular confessor, to whom the other may confide all his
hopes and fears, joys and sorrows; the second is this, that “a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>friend’s wits and understanding do clarify and break up in the
communicating and discoursing with another;” so that “he
waxeth wiser than himself; and that more by an hour’s discourse
than by a day’s meditation;” the third is the “aid and bearing a
part in all actions and occasions” to be expected of a friend.</p>

<p class='c001'>Friendship is not a modern sentiment. Cases of it such as
existed among the ancient Greeks and Romans, characterised by
an ardour that made Friendship resemble the Love passion, are no
longer to be met with, although a somewhat less intense form
frequently occurs among young men at college or young ladies in
high schools: thus illustrating the law that the individual passes
through the same stages of development as the race.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The enthusiasm of friendship,” says Voltaire in his <cite>Philosophic
Dictionary</cite>, “was greater among the Greeks and Arabians than it
is among ourselves. The tales which these peoples have imagined
on friendship are delightful; we have nothing to match them.
We are somewhat dry in everything. I do not see a single grand
trait of friendship in our novels, in our histories, on our stage.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Why is this so? Let another Frenchman, La Rochefoucauld,
answer: “The reason why the majority of women are but little
touched by friendship, is because it seems insipid after one has
experienced love.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Precisely. The reason why the ancients, in their histories and
dramas, made so much of friendship, while modern poets almost
ignore it, is that the latter have a subject a thousand times more
fascinating than friendship, a subject unknown to the ancients—the
inexhaustible subject of Romantic Love.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VII.—ROMANTIC LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>That Love is superior to friendship is apparent from the one
consideration that it includes <em>all</em> the features of friendship, and
adds to them a thousand ecstasies of which friendship never
dreams. The lover, no less than the friend, gratifies his social
instinct, his desire for companionship, his need of confessing his
own and sharing another’s hopes and fears, his craving for stimulating
conversation, his sympathetic disposition to give and receive
aid in the trials of life. But if modern friendship ever had any
moments to compare with the romantic episodes, the tragic agonies
and wild delights of love, would it be conceivable that our realistic
novelists and poets could neglect it altogether and devote all their
attention to Love?</p>

<p class='c001'>The other personal affections fare no better in comparison with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Love. How prosaic even Conjugal Love seems to us as compared
with Romantic Love, of which it is the metamorphosis and
continuation, is shown by the fact that novelists always end their
stories with the marriage of the hero and heroine.</p>

<p class='c001'>Maternal Love, however, has four traits which occasionally
make it resemble Romantic Love in intensity. They are: (1) a
disposition toward self-sacrifice; (2) jealousy; (3) an exaggerated
adoration; and (4) pride of ownership. But of these the first is
the only one that ever quite rises to the giddy heights of rapturous
Love. Jealousy is often aroused in mothers if their children
display excessive fondness or partiality for their father or a family
friend; and they know well in such a case how to make the latter
understand that his presence is an impertinence. But this
momentary ebullition of feeling is but a storm in a tea-kettle
compared to the ferocity of a jealous lover seeking to devour his
rival. Nor does a mother’s excessive worship of the self-evident
beauty and accomplishments of her offspring ever quite equal the
hyperbolic illusion and folly of a lover.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, Romantic Love is a monopolist who never shares his
treasures of affection with another, whereas a mother, if she has
more than one child, is obliged to divide her heart like an apple,
so that each may get a slice. Would you infer from this that the
mother has a deeper fund of affection than the lover, because she
can love several at a time? Impossible. The amount of emotion
human nerves can bear is limited. The more you widen it, the
shallower does it become. The general love for all mankind is
the weakest and shallowest of all, the <a id='corr27.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='lover s'>lover’s</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_27.27'><ins class='correction' title='lover s'>lover’s</ins></a></span> concentrated affection
for one person the deepest and strongest. See what a terrible
strain on his nerves this deep passion is: how he loses flesh,
grows pale and feverish, and prone to self-destruction. Could a
mother survive if she loved each one of five or ten children with
the depth and intensity of a lover? No, we must take back what
we said a few pages back. Maternal affection is after all a mere
phantom compared with Romantic Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>And the ace of hearts is yet to be played—in favour of
Romantic Love. The mother’s affection is bestowed on what
after all is merely a severed portion of her own individuality;
whereas the two lovers are individuals utterly unrelated. And
herein lies the Miracle of Love: that it can in a few days, ay, a
few minutes, ignite between two young persons who have perhaps
never before seen each other, a passion more intense than that
which in the mother is the growth of months and years.</p>

<p class='c001'>It follows as a corollary from this that Romantic Love is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>only more intense, more concentrated, more immediate and irresistible
than parental affection, but also more just, more in
accordance with the highest precepts of morality, because more
altruistic. For the mother loves only her own flesh and blood,
while the lover adores a stranger; like Romeo, he may even adore
the daughter of an enemy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thousands of fathers and mothers, moreover, love their own
ugly, vicious, and stupid children more than the beautiful, well-behaved,
and clever children of their neighbours. Who, on the
other hand, ever heard of a young man loving his ugly sister more
than the beautiful and accomplished daughter of his neighbour?</p>

<p class='c001'>In consideration of the great importance of the family feelings
as a social cement, the parental injustice in question is pardoned
and even commended. But from the standpoint of progressive
culture, under guidance of the law of Natural Selection, it must be
condemned; for it favours demerit in preference to merit, and
retards the advent of the time when family and national prejudices
will be forgotten and replaced by a loverlike, cosmopolitan admiration
of personal excellence wherever and in whomsoever found.</p>

<p class='c001'>This matter, though it has a semi-humorous aspect, is of the
deepest philosophic import. If family affection, so important as
the first step in the development of society, were the only form of
personal love, close intermarriage between blood-relations would be
unduly encouraged. Fortunately the all-powerful instinct of
Romantic Love comes in as a corrective of family affection, basing
its preferences not on relationship and resemblance, but on differences
and complementary qualities, thus securing for the human
race the advantages of “cross-fertilisation.” We have already seen
that flowers owe their beauty to the cross-fertilisation brought
about through the agency of bees and butterflies. In the same
way the human race owes its supreme beauty to the cross-fertilisation—the
union of complementary qualities—brought about through
the agency of Love. Is it perhaps for this reason that Love is so
much like a butterfly, and that Cupid has wings?</p>

<p class='c001'>Instead of being merely a transient malady of youth, as cynics
aver, or only an epicurean episode in our emotional life, Love is
thus seen to be one of the greatest (if not <em>the</em> greatest) moral,
æsthetic, and hygienic forces that control human life. And in face
of this fact the few pages, or lines, commonly devoted to this
passion in psychologic text-books, seem wofully inadequate. No
apology is therefore needed for our attempt to subject Romantic
Love to a thorough chemical analysis, and to discover its ingredients.
We shall first enumerate and briefly characterise these ingredients;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>then proceed to examine how many of them are to be found in the
love of animals and savages, of the ancient nations and of our
mediæval ancestors; and finally, we shall attempt to describe these
various component parts of the passion, as fully developed in
Modern Love.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>OVERTONES OF ROMANTIC LOVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>First of all it is necessary to get rid of the prevalent illusion
that Love is a single emotion. It is, on the contrary, a most
complex and ever-varying <em>group</em> of emotions. Love is not a
diamond which drops from a celestial body, cut and polished, and
ready to be set into the human soul. Rather is it the crown of
life, composed of various jewels, some of which, mixed with much
coarse ore, may be found in the animal kingdom, among primitive
men and ancient civilised nations; but of which no complete
specimens are to be found till we come to comparatively modern
times. Each lover has his own crown, but no two of them are
exactly alike. The component jewels vary in size and brilliancy.
Some—as Coyness, Adoration, Gallantry, Jealousy—are occasionally
missing or lacking in lustre; and in Ancient Love those are
habitually absent which in Modern Love are most prominent and
cherished.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps the composite nature of Love can be still better illustrated
by a comparison with colours, and with “overtones” in
music, between which and the elements of Love there exists a
wonderfully close analogy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Professor Helmholtz has proved that just as white is not a
simple colour, but a combination of all the hues of the rainbow, so
any single tone produced by the voice or a musical instrument is
not simple, as it seems, but contains, besides the <em>fundamental</em> tone
which the ordinary listener alone hears, several partial or “overtones,”
which blend so closely with the fundamental tone, that it
takes a very delicate ear and close attention to distinguish them.
Were it not for these overtones, all instruments would sound alike,
and music would lose all its charms of “colour.” For the fundamental
tones of instruments and voices are identical, and the only
thing that enables a musician to tell at a distance whether a given
note proceeds from a piano, voice, or violin, is the presence of these
overtones, which vary in their number, relative loudness and pitch
(or height), thus giving rise to the differences of quality or <em>timbre</em>
in instruments.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>In Love the fundamental tone is the sexual relation—the fact
that one of the lovers is male, the other female. This fundamental
tone does not vary throughout Nature. It is the same among
animals and savages as among civilised men; and what distinguishes
the passion of one of these groups from that of the other is alone
the overtones of love, which vary in number, relative prominence,
and refinement (“high-toned”).</p>

<p class='c001'>What are these overtones?</p>

<h3 class='c014'>I.—INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCE</h3>

<p class='c013'>What first ennobles Love and raises it above mere passion, is
the stubborn preference for a particular individual. A savage
chief ignorant of Love would not hesitate a moment to exchange
his bride for two or three other women equally young and tempting;
whereas a man under the influence of Love would not give
his beloved for the choice among all the beauties of the Caucasus
and Andalusia. “If we pass in review the different degrees of
love,” says Schopenhauer, “from the most transient attachment to
the most violent passion, we shall find that the difference between
them springs from their different degrees of <em>individualisation</em>.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>II.—MONOPOLY OR EXCLUSIVENESS</h3>

<p class='c013'>Closely connected with the first overtone is that of exclusiveness.
True Love is a monopolist. As in a sun-glass all the solar
rays are concentrated into one burning focus, so are the lover’s
emotions on his beloved. Not only does he care for <em>her</em> alone of
all women, but he voluntarily offers her a monopoly of <em>his</em> thoughts
and feelings. In return for this, however, he expects and exacts
of her a like monopoly of her affection and favours; and this leads
to the next overtone.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>III.—JEALOUSY</h3>

<p class='c013'>This is the salt and pepper of Love. A little of it is piquant,
too much of it spoils the soup. The moral mission of Jealousy is,
by means of watchfulness and the inspiring of fear, to ensure
fidelity and chastity, and thus help to develop the romantic
features of Love.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>IV.—COYNESS</h3>

<p class='c013'>This is a specially feminine trait of Love, which, by retarding
the eager lover’s conquest, augments and idealises his passion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>In Modern Love, Coyness varies in two directions—towards
prudery on one side, coquetry on the other.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>V.—GALLANTRY</h3>

<p class='c013'>If Coyness is a peculiarly feminine ingredient of Love, Gallantry,
on the other hand, is a specially masculine attribute. The eager
desire to please, it is true, is also present in a woman’s Love; but
it shows itself less as an active impulse to do something for the
lover, than as a desire to please him by making herself as attractive
as possible.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VI.—SELF-SACRIFICE</h3>

<p class='c013'>In the most violent cases of Love this overtone may reveal
itself in two ways: either as a mere exaggeration of Gallantry—a
desire to please even at the risk of life; or as a suicidal impulse in
cases of hopeless passion—when the one object which seemed to
make life worth living has been placed beyond reach.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VII.—SYMPATHY</h3>

<p class='c013'>“In order to feel with another’s pain it is enough to be a man;
to feel with another’s pleasure it is needful to be an angel.” If
this be true, then lovers are angels. For not only do they share
one another’s pleasures, but it is impossible for the one to be really
happy unless the other enjoys the same emotion. “Does that
other see the same star, the same melting cloud; read the same
book, feel the same emotion that now delights me?”—these are,
in Emerson’s words, the questions which the lovers, when separated,
ask incessantly.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VIII.—PRIDE OF CONQUEST AND POSSESSION</h3>

<p class='c013'>In his suggestive but incomplete analysis of Love, in his
<cite>Principles of Psychology</cite>, Mr. Herbert Spencer names as two
of the emotions which enter into it, the Love of Approbation and
Self-Esteem, which he thus defines: “To be preferred above all
the world, and that by one admired beyond all others, is to have
the love of approbation gratified in a degree passing every previous
experience: especially as, to this direct gratification of it, there
must be added that reflex gratification of it, which results from
the preference being witnessed by unconcerned persons. Further,
there is the allied emotion of self-esteem. To have succeeded in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>gaining such attachment from, and sway over, another, is a practical
proof of power, of superiority, which cannot fail agreeably to excite
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>amour propre</em></span>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This is well expressed, but the names are obviously not well
chosen. It is hardly correct to intimate that the “love of approbation”
and “self-esteem” constitute two of the group of emotions
which we call Love. What the lover <em>feels</em> is not a “love of
approbation,” etc., but the emotion of <em>Pride</em> at having conquered
and gained possession of so desirable a prize.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>IX.—EMOTIONAL HYPERBOLE</h3>

<p class='c013'>The lover sees, thinks, and feels only in superlatives. His
eyes are no longer mere “<em>windows</em> of the soul,” but <em>microscopes</em>
which magnify all the beloved’s merits on the scale of seven square
miles to the inch. And the hyberbolic imagery which constitutes
the essence of love-poetry is his everyday food—with a special
<em>menu</em> on Sundays.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>X.—MIXED MOODS—MAJOR AND MINOR</h3>

<p class='c013'>It is in Love that “confusion makes his masterpiece.” The
lover is so incessantly tossed on the ocean of turbulent emotion
that he soon ceases to know or care which is up and which down,
and all that remains is an all-engrossing sense of love-sickness.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>XI.—ADMIRATION OF PERSONAL BEAUTY</h3>

<p class='c013'>This is the æsthetic overtone of Love; and so prominent is it
that it is commonly heard before and above all the others.
“Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold,” says Shakspere;
and if you tell twenty of your male acquaintances that you have
been introduced to a young lady, nineteen of them will ask immediately,
“Is she pretty?” No reporter ever writes about
a girl murdered by a tramp or burnt in a house, without describing
her as a model of beauty, in order to double the reader’s interest
and quintuple his pity. Madame de Staël confessed that she
would have gladly exchanged her literary genius for beauty.
With the Greeks already the words Love and Beauty were inseparably
associated; and even the Chinese, who are not embarrassed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>by an excess of beauty, have a proverb, “With one
smile she overthrew a city, with another a kingdom.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This completes the preliminary analysis of Love. I regret
exceedingly that I have been able to discover only eleven “overtones”
in Modern Love: but inasmuch as at least six of these—Nos.
V. to X.—are only about a thousand years old, there is
reason to hope that some fine morning in May a new one will be
born to make up the round dozen. If so, it is to be hoped it will
assume in men the form of an absolute insistance on feminine
health, and an instinctive detestation of the hideous and love-killing
fashions with which women still persist in ruining their
beauty.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>HERBERT SPENCER ON LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>For the sake of comparison I may cite Mr. Spencer’s summary
of the elements which he thinks compose Love: “Round the
physical feeling forming the nucleus of the whole there are
gathered the feelings produced by personal beauty, that constituting
simple attachment, those of reverence, of love of approbation,
of self-esteem, of property, of love of freedom, of sympathy. All
these, each excited in the highest degree, and severally tending to
reflect their excitement on each other, form the composite psychical
state which we call Love. And as each of these feelings is
in itself highly complicated, uniting a wide range of states of consciousness,
we may say that this passion fuses into an immense
aggregation, nearly all the elementary excitations of which we are
capable; and that from this results its irresistible power.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us now see how many of the characters of true Romantic
Love are to be found in the courtship of animals and savages.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>LOVE AMONG ANIMALS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>As comparative psychology is the youngest branch of philosophy,
there are still among us thousands of excellent but ignorant folks
who cling to the old mythologic notion that animals are animated
machines or things “which” are devoid of intellect and feeling,
and guided by a metaphysical fetish called “instinct.” To such
the undertaking of a search for Love—real Romantic Love—among
animals, will seem not only absurd, but a sort of high
treason against human conceit. To mitigate any possible indignation
on the reader’s part, it may be advisable, therefore, to begin
by giving a few illustrations demonstrating the existence of various
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>family affections and friendship in the animal world; after which, the
possibility of finding traces of Love proper will appear less remote.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Paternal, filial, brotherly, and sisterly</em> love, comparatively
weak and undeveloped in man, are indeed almost absent in the
lower animals. Birds of the same brood do not recognise each
other after they have left their nest; and a dog will not hesitate
to attack his own brother as a stranger after a year’s separation.
The part which a male bird takes in feeding and protecting the
young is, as Horwicz suggests, an element of his conjugal rather
than his paternal feeling; and a young animal that would risk its
own life in defence of its mother or father is yet to be heard from.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Friendship</em>, however, does exist between animals, as we have
already seen; and not only among animals of the same species,
but of different species. “Happy families” of animals commonly
hostile to each other have been known outside of the showman’s
cage. Büchner cites instances of friendship between a robin and a
cat; a fox and duck; dog and deer; cat and mouse; and even
such absurdly incongruous cases of attachment as between a crow
and a bull; a dog and an elephant; a cat and a rattlesnake. But the
deepest feeling of friendship which any animal is capable of feeling
is undoubtedly the dog’s love of his master. “Professor Braubach,”
says Darwin, “goes so far as to maintain that a dog looks on his
master as on a god.” “It is said,” he adds in a footnote, “that
Bacon long ago, and the poet Burns, held the same notion.”</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Maternal and conjugal</em> affection, however, are, as in man, so
in animals, the two strongest forms of family attachment. A
French author, M. Menault, has written a special treatise on
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>L’Amour Maternel chez les Animaux</cite></span>, and Dr. Büchner exclaims,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>à propos</i></span>: “If a human mother, with certain destruction staring
in her face, dashes into a burning house to save her imperilled
child, and thus finds her own death, this sacrifice is no greater, no
more heroic, than that of a stork-mother who, after vain efforts to
save her brood, is voluntarily burnt up with them in her nest; or
of those elephant-mothers who, as Schweinfurth narrates, in the
African hunting expeditions, when the bushes along the shore are
ignited in order to drive out the elephants, seek to save their
young ones by filling their trunks with water and sprinkling it
over them, while they themselves are roasting.”</p>

<p class='c001'>How low down in the scale of animal life traces of <em>conjugal</em>
attachment are to be found is shown by the following case cited
by Darwin: “An accurate observer, Mr. Lonsdale, informs me
that he placed a pair of landsnails, one of which was weakly, into
a small and ill-provided garden. After a short time the strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>and healthy individual disappeared, and was traced by its track of
slime over a wall into an adjoining well-stocked garden. Mr.
Lonsdale concluded that it had deserted its sickly mate, but after
an absence of twenty-four hours it returned, and apparently communicated
the result of its successful exploration, for both then
started along the same track and disappeared over the wall.”
Again, the naturalist, Mr. Bate, experimented on the conjugal
feelings of <em>Gammarus marinus</em>, or the sandskipper common on
English shores, by separating a male from its female, and imprisoning
both in the same vessel with many individuals of the
same species. “The female, when thus divorced, soon joined the
others. After a time the male was put again into the same
vessel; and he then, after swimming about for a time, dashed
into the crowd, and without any fighting at once took away his
wife. This fact shows that in the Amphipoda, an order low in
the scale, the males and females recognise each other, and are
mutually attached.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Concerning birds, Darwin remarks: “It has often been said
that parrots become so deeply attached to each other that when
one dies the other pines for a long time; but Mr. Jenner Weir
thinks that with most birds the strength of their affection has
been much exaggerated. Nevertheless, when one of a pair in a
state of nature has been shot, the survivor has been heard for days
afterwards uttering a plaintive call; and Mr. St. John gives
various facts proving the attachment of mated birds. Mr. Bennett
relates that in China after a drake of the beautiful mandarin Teal
had been stolen, the duck remained disconsolate, though sedulously
courted by another mandarin drake, who displayed before her all
his charms. After an interval of three weeks the stolen drake
was recovered, and instantly the pair recognised each other with
extreme joy.” “Dr. Buller says (<cite>Birds of New Zealand</cite>) that a
male king lory was killed, and the female ‘fretted and moped, refused
her food, and died of a broken heart.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>But there are exceptions to this rule of conjugal attachment
and fidelity, as is shown in the following quotation, which completes
the curious analogy between human and bird love connubial:
“Mr. Harrison Weir has himself observed, and has heard from
several breeders, that a female pigeon will occasionally take a
strong fancy for a particular male, and will desert her own mate
for him. Some females, according to another experienced observer,
Riedel, are of a profligate disposition, and prefer almost any stranger
to their own mate. Some amorous males, called by our English
fanciers ‘gay birds,’ are so successful in their gallantries that, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Mr. H. Weir informs me, they must be shut up on account of the
mischief which they cause.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So there are Don Juans even among pigeons!</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Intermarriages</em> or mixed unions also occur among birds. Says
Darwin: “It is certain that distinct species of birds occasionally
pair in a state of nature and produce hybrids. Many instances
could be given: thus Macgillivray relates how a male blackbird
and female thrush ‘fell in love with each other,’ and produced
offspring. Several years ago eighteen cases had been recorded of
the occurrence in Great Britain of hybrids between the black
grouse and pheasant.... A male widgeon, living with females
of the same species, has been known to pair with a pintail duck.
Lloyd describes the remarkable attachment between a shield-drake
and a common duck. Many additional instances could be given;
and the Rev. E. S. Dixon remarks that ‘those who have kept
many different species of geese together, well know what unaccountable
attachments they are frequently forming, and that they are
quite as likely to pair and rear young with individuals of a race
(species) apparently the most alien to themselves, as with their
own stock.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>In their <em>marriages</em> animals have anticipated man in every
possible arrangement—promiscuity, polygamy, monogamy, polyandry.
According to Darwin, “Many mammals and some few
birds are polygamous, but with other animals belonging to the
lower classes I have found no evidence of this habit.” He has
not “heard of any species in the Orders of Cheiroptera, Edentata,
Insectivora, and Rodents being polygamous, excepting that among
the Rodents the common rat, according to some rat-catchers, lives
with several females.” Among the terrestrial carnivora the lion
seems to be the only polygamist, while the marine carnivora are
“eminently polygamous.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Domestication sometimes has the bad effect of converting wild
birds to Mormonism. Thus “the wild duck is strictly monogamous,
the domestic duck highly polygamous.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is among wild birds in general that the most remarkable
cases of conjugal attachment in the animal world are found.
And since most birds are monogamous, pairing sometimes even for
life, we may hence draw the important conclusion that among
animals, as among men, monogamy seems to favour the development
of conjugal love. Polygamy, on the other hand, everywhere
introduces jealousies, rivalries, discords. Among Oriental nations
where polygamy prevails, each wife must have her own apartments,
and no one would dare to taste food prepared by another, for fear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>of poison. On some animals polygamy seems to have a similar
effect, for we read that “Mr. Bartlett believes that the Lophophorus,
like many other gallinaceous birds, is naturally polygamous,
but two females cannot be placed in the same cage with a male, as
they fight so much together.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>COURTSHIP</h3>

<p class='c013'>The foregoing illustrations, many of which show the gross
injustice lurking in our expression “animal passion,” will have
prepared the reader’s mind for the search after the elements of
<em>romantic</em> or pre-nuptial Love in animals.</p>

<p class='c001'>The development of romantic, as distinguished from conjugal
love, depends on the existence of <em>a more or less prolonged period of
courtship</em>. Where this is absent Love is absent, as among the
ancient nations and those of the moderns who lock up their women
until they are ready to be sold to a husband, at sight.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among animals the young females are not locked up or
chaperoned. They are free to meet the young males and fall in
love with the one that pleases them most.</p>

<p class='c001'>As a rule the preliminaries to animal marriages are doubtless
brief. If a healthy, vigorous male comes across a mature, healthy
female, it is usually a case of mutual <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>veni, vidi, vici</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In other cases, however, courtship is a more prolonged affair,
owing partly to the coyness of the female, partly to the rivalries
among the male suitors.</p>

<p class='c001'>Animal courtship is carried on either by single pairs in the
romantic shades of the forests, or else at special <em>nuptial mass
meetings</em>, resembling those held by some primitive tribes whose
unmarried young people assemble on certain days in the year to
select partners. Of the common magpie, for instance, Darwin
relates that “Some years ago these birds abounded in extraordinary
numbers, so that a gamekeeper killed in one morning nineteen
males, and another killed by a single shot seven birds roosting
together. They then had the habit of assembling very early in
the spring at particular spots, where they could be seen in flocks,
chattering, sometimes fighting, bustling, and flying about the
trees. The whole affair was evidently considered by the birds as one
of the highest importance. Shortly after the meeting they all
separated, and were then observed by Mr. Fox and others to be
paired for the season.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This was known as the “great magpie marriage.” In Germany
and Scandinavia similar assemblages of black game are so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>common that special names have been given to them. “The
bowers of the bower-birds are the resort of both sexes during the
breeding season; and here the males meet and contend with each
other for the favours of the females, and here the latter assemble
and coquet with the males.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Two more cases may be cited: “With one of the vultures
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Cathartes aura</i></span>) of the United States parties of eight, ten, or
more males and females assemble on fallen logs, ‘exhibiting the
strongest <em>desire to please</em> mutually,’ and after many caresses each
male leads off his partner on the wing. Audubon likewise carefully
observed the wild flocks of Canada geese, and gives a graphic
description of their love-antics; he says that the birds which had
been previously mated ‘renewed their courtship as early as the
month of January, while the others would be contending or
coquetting for hours every day, until all seemed satisfied with the
choice they had made, after which, although they remained together,
any person could easily perceive that they were careful to
keep in pairs. I have observed also that the older the birds the
shorter were the preliminaries of their courtship. The bachelors
and old maids, whether in regret or not caring to be disturbed by
the bustle, quietly moved aside and lay down at some distance
from the rest.’”</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Separate courtship</em> may be illustrated by the following cases,
the first of which is also interesting as showing that it is not
among men alone that the female occasionally becomes the wooer;
and the second as showing how early in the scale of animal life a
primitive sort of courtship may be found. Concerning a wild duck
brought up in captivity Mr. Hewitt says that “After breeding a
couple of seasons with her own mallard, it at once shook him off
on my placing a male pintail on the water. It was evidently a
case of <em>love at first sight</em>, for she swam about the newcomer caressingly,
though he appeared evidently alarmed and averse to her
overtures of affection. From that hour she forgot her old partner.
Winter passed by, and the next spring the pintail seemed to have
become a convert to her blandishments, for they nested and produced
seven or eight young ones.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The second case relates to the landsnail, concerning which
Agassiz says: “Quiconque a eu l’occasion d’observer les amours
des limaçons ne saurait mettre en doute la séduction déployée dans
les mouvements et les allures qui préparent et accomplissent le
double embrassement de ces hermaphrodites.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The opportunities for prolonged Courtship being thus given, the
question arises, “Do animals, while a-wooing, experience the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>feelings as a human lover?” In other words, Are any of the overtones
of Romantic Love present in the amorous passion of animals?</p>

<p class='c001'>Several of them no doubt are habitually absent. Animals have
not sufficient imagination to meditate consciously on their probable
success or failure in Courtship; and this lack of imaginative power
excludes those “overtones” which are chiefly dependent on that
faculty; notably Sympathy with the beloved’s feelings, Pride of
Conquest and Possession, Hyperbolic Adoration, Voluntary Self-Sacrifice
for the other, and the Woful Ecstasy of Mixed Moods.
That Gallantry, or the Desire to Please, <em>may</em> be present is shown
by the words I have italicised in the quotation just made regarding
the courtship of vultures, and is further shown by the display of
their ornamental plumage by male birds to excite the attention of
the female. Exclusiveness of affection is indicated by the occasional
indifference of the wooer to every rival; and when we read
of the German blackcock’s love-dances, during which, “the more
ardent he grows the more lively he becomes, until at last the bird
appears like a frantic creature”; and that “at such times the
blackcocks are so absorbed that they become almost <em>blind and deaf</em>,
but less so than the capercailzie,” so that “bird after bird may be
shot on the spot, or even caught by the hand”—when we read
this, we feel tempted to credit these birds even with those highest
and most specialised forms of lover’s madness which lead to oblivion—Self-Sacrifice
and Ecstatic Adoration.</p>

<p class='c001'>The four traits of Romantic Love which are doubtless present
in the passion of animals are Jealousy, Coyness, Individual Preference,
and Admiration of Personal Beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>a</i>) <em>Jealousy.</em>—Volumes might be filled with accounts of the
tragedies brought about through animal rivalry and jealousy during
the season of love. “The courage and the desperate conflicts of
stags have often been described,” says Darwin; “their skeletons
have been found in various parts of the world, with the horns inextricably
locked together, showing how miserably the victor and
vanquished had perished.” “Male sperm-whales are very jealous”
at the season of love; “and in their battles ‘they often lock their
jaws together, and turn on their sides and twist about’; so that
their lower jaws often become distorted.”</p>

<p class='c001'>When birds gaze at themselves in a looking-glass, as they often
do, the same authority inclines to the belief that they do it from
jealousy of a supposed rival; and Mr. Jenner Weir, he states, “is
convinced that birds pay particular attention to the colours of
other birds, sometimes out of jealousy, and sometimes as a sign of
kinship;” while “many naturalists believe that the singing of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>birds is almost exclusively ‘the effect of rivalry and emulation,’
and not for the sake of charming their mates.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Animal Jealousy is apparently dependent on the immediate
presence of the rival and the female; while the Jealousy of a
human lover is also a matter of the imagination, and smarts even
more intensely during Her absence; for his morbid fancy then loves
to picture Her in the arms of his victorious rival. He does not,
however, except in some southern countries, emulate the jealous
lion by seeking to devour his rival, but is contented if he can ward
him off by stratagem, or make him appear in a disadvantageous
light in Her eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>b</i>) <em>Coyness.</em>—Just as the Jealousy displayed by two animals
fighting for a female is a gross, primitive emotion, so the Coyness
of female animals is crude and clumsy compared with the delicious
subtlety with which a human maiden veils a Yes under an
apparent No. Yet it plays a prominent <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span> in the courtship of
animals.</p>

<p class='c001'>A human lover would often consider it a special privilege to be
eaten up, skin, bones, and all, by his mistress; but it is doubtful
whether spiders are ever madly enough in love to relish the conduct
of their females, as described by Darwin: “The male is generally
much smaller than the female, sometimes to an extraordinary
degree, and he is forced to be extremely cautious in making his
advances, as the female often carries her coyness to a dangerous
pitch. De Geer saw a male that ‘in the midst of his preparatory
caresses was seized by the object of his attentions, enveloped by
her in a web, and then devoured’; a sight which, as he adds, filled
him with indignation and horror. Female fishes also are apt to
give a cannibal tinge to their coyness by eating up the smaller
males—actions to which remote human analogies may be found in
the coyness of mediæval dames, who sent their lovers to wars and
into lions’ dens as conditions of enjoying their favours; or, conversely,
in the habits of those Australians who eat their wives
after they have ceased to be either ornamental or useful.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Indubitable evidences of Coyness are found as low down as
among insects; as, for example, in the species called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Smynthurnus
luteus</i></span>, “wingless, dull-coloured, minute insects, with ugly, almost
misshapen heads and bodies,” concerning which Sir John Lubbock
remarks: “It is very amusing to see these little creatures
coquetting together. The male, which is much smaller than the
female, runs round her, and they butt one another standing face
to face and moving backward and forward like two playful lambs.
Then the female pretends to run away, and the male runs after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>her with a queer appearance of anger, gets in front and stands
facing her again; then she turns coyly round, but he, quicker and
more active, scuttles round too, and seems to whip her with his
antennæ; then for a bit they stand face to face, play with their
antennæ, and seem to be all in all to one another.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Coyness of birds is illustrated by the following cases cited
by Büchner from Brehm and A. and K. Müller: “A genuine
coquette is the female cuckoo, who answers the call of the male
with a peculiar resonant, tittering or laughing love-call. ‘The
call is seducing, promising in advance, and its effect on the male
simply enchanting.’ But how long the lovers pursuing the siren
have to wait before she accepts one of them! A wild flight
begins, among bushes and tree-tops, while the female encourages
the pursuers with repeated calls, and finally gets them into a state
of erotic excitement bordering on madness. At the same time the
female is no less excited than her frantic suitors. Her favourite,
no doubt, is the most eager of the lovers, and her apparent
resistance simply the desire to excite him still more!... The
female of the icebird (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Alcedo ispida</i></span>) often teases her lover half a
day at a time, by repeatedly approaching him, screaming at him,
and flying away again. At the same time she never loses sight of
him, but in her flight casts glances at him backwards and sidewise,
moderates the rapidity of her flight, and returns in a wide
curve if the male suddenly ceases from his pursuit.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Could anything be more naïvely, more humanly, more
exquisitely feminine? If a lover, says a French philosopher, fails
in his suit, let him desist for a moment, and she will presently
call him back.</p>

<p class='c001'>No inquiry has ever been made by naturalists, so far as I am
aware, as to the origin of Coyness among animals. Two probable
sources of this feeling may therefore be here suggested. The first
is a vague instinctive presentiment (based on inherited cerebral
impressions) that with mating the labours of life will begin: the
painful laying of eggs; the loss of liberty during incubation—an
incalculable loss to these most active of all animals; and the care
of the young, which, again, is not a trifling matter, inasmuch as a
family of starlings, for example, needs for its daily food more than
eight hundred snails, caterpillars, etc.; and birds sometimes perish
from exhaustion in the attempt to feed their offspring.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second source of Coyness is probably another instinctive
feeling (based on inherited experience) which induces the female
to defer her choice until the combats and man&oelig;uvres of the males
have shown which one is the most energetic, courageous, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>persistent: for he will obviously be best able to support her
brood, and protect it as well as herself against enemies. Hence,
during the combats of rival males, the female is commonly a
passive spectator, and at the end quietly marches or flies off with
the victor. All of which, by the way, shows that among animals
already masculine love is deeper than feminine. Indirectly, it is
true, feminine Coyness is the cause of Love—but only of <em>masculine</em>
Love; for if the female animal always accepted the first male
who asked her—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“My pretty maiden, may I venture</div>
      <div class='line'>To offer you my arm and escort?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>there would be no opportunity for the growth of pre-matrimonial
passion.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>c</i>) <em>Individual Preference.</em>—Owing to our scant information
concerning the courtship of animals in a state of nature, Darwin
did not succeed in discovering any cases among mammals of
decided preference shown by a male for any particular female;
and regarding domesticated quadrupeds, “The general impression
amongst breeders seems to be that the male accepts any female;
and this, owing to his eagerness, is, in most cases, probably the
truth.” A few cases of special preference or antipathy in dogs,
horses, bulls, and boars, were, however, communicated to him.
Concerning birds Darwin remarks that “In all ordinary cases the
male is so eager that he will accept any female, and does not, as
far as we can judge, prefer one to the other, but ... exceptions
to this rule apparently occur in some few groups. With
domesticated birds, I have heard of only one case of males
showing any preference for certain females, namely, that of the
domestic cock, who, according to the high authority of Mr.
Hewitt, prefers the younger to the older hens.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This, however, is at best only a polygamous sort of Preference,
which, after all, lacks the essential traits of Individualisation and
Exclusiveness. With the long-tailed duck (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Harelda glacialis</i></span>),
M. Ekström says, “It has been remarked that certain females are
much more courted than the rest. Frequently, indeed, one sees
an individual surrounded by six or eight amorous males.”
Whether this statement is credible Darwin does not know; but
the Swedish sportsmen, he adds, shoot these females and stuff
them as decoys.</p>

<p class='c001'>In female animals, on the other hand, the “overtone” of
Individual Preference appears to be more frequently present.
Darwin even asserts that “the exertion of some choice on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>part of the female seems a law almost as general as the eagerness
of the male;” but this is not borne out by the numerous illustrations
given by himself, showing that when two or more males are
engaged in jealous combat, “the female looks on as a passive
spectator,” and finally goes off with the victor, whichever of the
rivals he may prove to be, without showing the slightest concern
for the vanquished. An Australian forest-maiden might behave
similarly under these circumstances, but a civilised maiden would
cling to the one who had made the deepest impression on her
previous to the combat; and if wounded, would adore him all the
more; for in her Love pity is a stronger ingredient than even the
love of prowess.</p>

<p class='c001'>That female birds, however, <em>sometimes</em> exert a choice is admitted
even by Mr. A. R. Wallace (<cite>Tropical Nature</cite>, p. 199); and a few
of the cases referred to by Darwin may here be cited: “Audubon—and
we must remember that he spent a long life in prowling
about the forests of the United States and observing the birds—does
not doubt that the female deliberately chooses her mate;
thus, speaking of a woodpecker, he says the hen is followed by half
a dozen gay suitors, who continue performing strange antics ‘until
a marked preference is shown for one.’ The female of the red-winged
starling (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Agelæus ph&oelig;niceus</i></span>) is likewise pursued by several
males, ‘until, becoming fatigued, she alights, receives their
addresses, and soon makes a choice.’ He describes also how
several male nightjars repeatedly plunge through the air with
astonishing rapidity, suddenly turning, and thus making a singular
noise; ‘but no sooner has the female made her choice than the
other males are driven away.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>Concerning domesticated birds we have seen that that gallinaceous
sultan, the domestic cock, shows a decided preference for the
younger hens in his harem. But the female is not a bit less
frivolous and capricious; for, according to Mr. Hewitt, she almost
invariably prefers the most vigorous, defiant, and mettlesome male;
hence it is almost useless, he adds, “to attempt true breeding if a
game-cock in good health and condition runs the locality, for
almost every hen on leaving the roosting-place will resort to the
game-cock, even though that bird may not actually drive away the
male of her own variety.”</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>d</i>) <em>Personal Beauty and Sexual Selection.</em>—Mr. Wallace, who
discovered the law of Natural Selection independently of Darwin,
admits, as just stated, that “in birds the females do sometimes
exert a choice”; but he adds that “amid the copious mass of
facts and opinions collected by Mr. Darwin as to the display of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>colour and ornaments by the male birds, there is <em>a total absence of
any evidence that the females admire or even notice this display</em>.
The hen, the turkey, and the pea-fowl go on feeding while the
male is displaying his finery; and there is reason to believe that
it is his persistency and energy rather than his beauty which wins
the day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Briefly stated, the difference between the views of these two
eminent naturalists is this: Darwin believes that in those cases
where the sexes are not alike, the differences are due to the <em>males</em>,
originally plain, having become modified through <em>Sexual</em> Selection
for <em>ornamental</em> purposes; while Mr. Wallace believes that colour
is a normal product in animal integuments, proportionate to their
vitality, and that the sexual differences in ornamentation are due
to the <em>females</em> having been modified through <em>Natural</em> Selection for
the sake of <em>protection</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps the best brief <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>résumé</i></span> Darwin has made of his views
on this subject is given on page 421 of the <cite>Descent of Man</cite>
(London edition, 1885), which may therefore be here cited in full:
"If an inhabitant of another planet were to behold a number of
young rustics at a fair courting a pretty girl, and quarrelling about
her like birds at one of their places of assemblage, he would, by
the eagerness of the wooers to please her and to display their
finery, infer that she had the power of choice. Now with birds
the evidence stands thus: they have acute powers of observation,
and they seem to have some taste for the beautiful both in colour
and sound. It is certain that the females occasionally exhibit, from
unknown causes, the strongest antipathies and preferences for
particular males. When the sexes differ in colour or in other
ornaments, the males with rare exceptions are the more decorated,
either permanently or during the breeding season. They sedulously
display their various ornaments, exert their voices, and perform
strange antics in the presence of the females. Even well-armed
males who, it might be thought, would altogether depend for
success on the law of battle, are in most cases highly ornamented;
and their ornaments have been acquired at the expense of some
loss of power. In other cases ornaments have been acquired at
the cost of increased risk from birds and beasts of prey. With
various species many individuals of both sexes congregate at the
same spot, and their courtship is a prolonged affair. There is
even reason to suspect that the males and females within the same
district do not always succeed in pleasing each other and pairing.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What then are we to conclude from these facts and considerations?
Does the male parade his charms with so much pomp and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>rivalry for no purpose? Are we not justified in believing that the
female exerts a choice, and that she receives the addresses of the
male who pleases her most? It is not probable that she consciously
deliberates; but she is most excited or attracted by the most
beautiful, or melodious, or gallant males. Nor need it be supposed
that the female studies each stripe or spot of colour; that the
peahen, for instance, admires each detail in the gorgeous train of
the peacock—she is probably struck only by the general effect.
Nevertheless, after hearing how carefully the male Argus pheasant
displays his elegant primary wing-feathers, and erects his ocellated
plumes in the right position for their full effect; or again, how the
male goldfinch alternately displays his gold-bespangled wings, we
ought not to feel too sure that the female does not attend to each
detail of beauty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Now it was this very case of the Argus pheasant that first shook
Mr. Wallace’s “belief in ‘sexual,’ or, more properly, ‘female’
selection. The long series of gradations by which the beautifully-shaped
ocelli on the secondary wing-feathers of this bird have been
produced are clearly traced out; the result being a set of markings
so exquisitely shaded as to represent ‘balls lying loose within
sockets’—purely artificial objects of which these birds could have
no possible experience. That this result should have been attained
through thousands and tens of thousands of female birds all preferring
those males whose markings varied slightly in this one
direction, this uniformity of choice continuing through thousands
and tens of thousands of generations, is to me absolutely incredible.
And when, further, we remember that those who did not so vary
would also, according to all evidence, find mates and have offspring,
the actual result seems quite impossible of attainment by such
means.”</p>

<p class='c001'>According to Darwin’s own admission (<cite>Descent of Man</cite>, p.
211), he advanced the theory of Sexual Selection because, in his
opinion, Natural Selection did not account for the various ornaments
and attractions of the males in question. Mr. Wallace,
on the other hand, believes that Sexual Selection does <em>not</em>, while
Natural Selection <em>does</em> account for these ornaments; so, in place
of Darwin’s view that the beauty of certain male animals leads
the females to prefer them to their less ornamented rivals, he substitutes
the theory that it is the superior vitality, persistence, and
vivacity of the favoured males that fascinate the females, and that
masculine beauty is simply a natural result of superior vigour and
superabundant health.</p>

<p class='c001'>Darwin doubtless errs in claiming an æsthetic sense for animals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>so low in the scale of life as butterflies and other insects, and in
attributing to it such extraordinary effects in the development of
personal beauty. What Mr. Wallace has done in <cite>Tropical
Nature</cite> is to show simply that it is quite unnecessary to invoke
the aid of so questionable an agency as Sexual Selection in order
to account for the ornaments of animals; and that the fundamental
principle of Darwinism, <em>Natural</em> Selection, accounts for
everything.</p>

<p class='c001'>He maintains that colour is a normal product of organisation,
and that not so much its presence as its absence needs accounting
for. White and black are comparatively rare and exceptional in
nature, while the various tints of red, blue, green, etc., are
continually appearing spontaneously and irregularly in the integuments
of animals. These irregular colours, if injurious to the
species, will be at once eliminated by Natural Selection; but if
useful for purposes of identification or protection, they will be
preserved and intensified.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now colour, Mr. Wallace continues, is proportionate to integumentary
development, and is most conspicuous in the wings of
butterflies and the feathers of birds, for the reason that, just as
“the spots and rings on a soap-bubble increase with increasing
tenuity,” similarly the delicately-organised surface of feathers and
scales is highly favourable to the production of varied colour-effects.</p>

<p class='c001'>Colour being thus proportionate to integumentary development,
we find next that integumentary development is, in turn, proportionate
to vigour and vitality; the strongest animals having the
largest feathers, scales, horns, etc. Hence the most vigorous and
healthy animals are also the most beautiful, the most brilliantly
coloured. And this correlation between healthful vigour and
beauty is still more strikingly shown in this, that “The colours of
an animal usually fade during disease or weakness, while robust
health and vigour adds to their intensity.... In all quadrupeds
a ‘dull coat’ is indicative of ill-health or low condition; while a
glossy coat and sparkling eye are the invariable accompaniments
of health and energy. The same rule applies to the feathers of
birds, whose colours are only seen in their purity during perfect
health; and a similar phenomenon occurs even among insects, for
the bright hues of caterpillars begin to fade as soon as they
become inactive preparatory to their undergoing transformation.
Even in the vegetable kingdom we see the same thing: for the
tints of foliage are deepest, and the colours of flowers and fruits
richest, on those plants which are in the most healthy and
vigorous condition.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Add to all these considerations that “this intensity of coloration
becomes most developed during the breeding season, when the
vitality is at a maximum,” and we shall be prepared for Mr.
Wallace’s summing up of his case:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“If now we accept the evidence of Mr. Darwin’s most trustworthy
correspondents, that the choice of the female, so far as she
exerts any, falls upon ‘the most vigorous, defiant, and mettlesome
male’; and if we further believe, what is certainly the case, that
these are as a rule the most highly-coloured and adorned with
the finest developments of plumage, we have a real and not
a hypothetical cause at work. For these most healthy, vigorous,
and beautiful males will have the choice of the finest and most
healthy females; and will be able best to protect and rear those
families. Natural Selection, and what may be termed Male
Selection, will tend to give them the advantage in the struggle
for existence; and thus the fullest and the finest colours will be
transmitted, and tend to advance in each succeeding generation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>By this strong chain of reasoning (to which my brief <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>>résumé</i></span> of
course cannot do justice) Mr. Wallace shows that Darwin needlessly
introduced the principle of Sexual Selection into animal
courtship; and at the same time furnishes a new confirmation of
Darwin’s compliment that he has “an innate genius for solving
difficulties.”</p>

<p class='c001'>What makes Mr. Wallace’s argument the more cogent is the
fact that Darwin himself, in speaking of the lowest classes of
animals, explains their beauty on the same principles as those
which Mr. Wallace applies to the higher animals. Thus he says:
“We can, in our ignorance of most of the lowest animals, only
say that their bright tints result either from the chemical nature
or the minute structure of their tissues, independently of any
benefit thus derived.” “It is almost certain that these animals
have too imperfect senses, and much too low mental powers, to
appreciate each other’s beauty or other attractions, or to feel
rivalry.” “Nor is it at all obvious how the offspring from the
more beautiful pairs of hermaphrodites would have any advantage
over the offspring of the less beautiful, so as to increase in
number, <em>unless indeed vigour and beauty generally coincided</em>.”
And once more, “The sedentary annelids become duller-coloured,
according to M. Quatrefages, after the period of reproduction;
and this I presume may be attributed to their less vigorous
condition at that time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So far we have only considered the origin of animal colours in
general. Mr. Wallace, however, has not only made clear the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>general connection between beautiful and vivid colours and health,
but, by utilising his own researches and those of Mr. Bates and
other naturalists, he has been able to show to what a great extent
we can explain even the <em>particular</em> colours of the various classes
of animals. He distinguishes four classes of animal colours—Protective,
Warning, Sexual, and Typical.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <em>Protective Colours.</em>—These “are exceedingly prevalent in
nature, comprising those of all the white arctic animals, the sandy-coloured
desert forms, and the green birds and insects of tropical
forests. It also comprises thousands of cases of special resemblance—of
birds to the surroundings of their nests, and especially of
insects to the bark, leaves, flowers, or soil on or amid which they
dwell. Mammalia, fishes, and reptiles, as well as mollusca, present
similar phenomena; and the more the habits of animals are investigated,
the more numerous are found to be the cases in which their
colours tend to conceal them, either from their enemies or from the
creatures they prey upon.”</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <em>Warning Colours.</em>—In this class, on the other hand, the
object is not to conceal the animal, but to make it conspicuous.
Certain species of gorgeously-coloured butterflies, <i>e.g.</i> are never
eaten by birds, spiders, lizards, or monkeys, who eagerly feed on
other butterflies. “The reason simply is that they are not fit to
eat, their juices having a powerful odour and taste that is absolutely
disgusting to all these animals. Now we see the reason of
their showy colours and slow flight. It is good for them to be
seen and recognised, for then they are never molested; but if they
did not differ in form and colouring from other butterflies, or if
they flew so quickly that their peculiarities could not be easily
noticed, they would be captured, and though not eaten, would be
maimed or killed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mimicry is the name given to a second and still more marvellous
class of Warning Colours. They belong to defenceless creatures
which so closely resemble other brightly-coloured but nauseous or
dangerous animals that they are mistaken for the latter, and
therefore left alone. <i>E.G.</i> “Wasps are imitated by moths, and
ants by beetles; and even poisonous snakes are mimicked by
harmless snakes, and dangerous hawks by defenceless cuckoos.”</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <em>Typically</em>-coloured animals are those species which are
brilliantly coloured in both sexes, “and for whose particular
colours we can assign no function or use.” This group “comprises
an immense number of showy birds, such as Kingfishers, Barbets,
Toucans, Lories, Tits, and Starlings; among insects most of the
largest and handsomest butterflies,” etc. “It is a suggestive fact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>that all the brightly-coloured birds mentioned above build in holes
or form covered nests, so that the females do not need that protection
during the breeding season which I believe to be one of the
chief causes of the dull colour of female birds when their partners
are gaily coloured.”</p>

<p class='c001'>(4) <em>Sexual Colours</em>, comprising those cases in which the sexes
differ, and with which Darwin’s theory of Sexual Selection is
directly concerned. Through no <em>direct</em> fault of his own, Darwin
leaves on his readers the impression—which has become almost a
commonplace of conversation—that it is the general rule among
animals for the males of each species to be more ornamented than
the females. The truth is, however, that “with the exception of
butterflies, the sexes are almost alike in the great majority of
insects. The same is the case in mammals and reptiles; while
the chief departure from the rule occurs in birds, though even here
in very many cases the law of sexual likeness prevails.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The reason why I have devoted so much space to Mr. Wallace’s
colour theories is to emphasise the truth contained in this last
sentence; the fact, namely, that even if Sexual Selection were
accepted as an active principle, it would account in only a very
limited number of cases for the personal beauty of animals, and
the reader of Mr. Wallace’s <cite>Tropical Nature</cite> and his <cite>Contributions
to the Theory of Natural Selection</cite> cannot fail to be convinced that
Sexual Selection does not even hold good in this limited number
of cases, but that “the primary cause of sexual diversity of colour
is the need of protection, repressing in the female those bright
colours which are normally produced in both sexes by general
laws.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Incidentally Mr. Wallace mentions as an additional function of
colour the fact that it may serve as a <em>means of recognition</em> to the
sexes. “This view affords us an explanation of the curious fact
that among butterflies the females of closely-allied species in the
same locality sometimes differ considerably, while the males are
much alike; for, as the males are the swiftest, and by far the
highest flyers, and seek out the females, it would evidently be
advantageous for them to be able to recognise their true partners
at some distance off.”</p>

<p class='c001'>To me it seems that this function of colour is, next to Protection,
its most important object, and that Mr. Wallace does not
give it sufficient prominence. He says, in speaking of <em>Typical
Colours</em>, that we can assign “no function or use for them.” But
why should they not serve the sexes as a means of recognition at
at a distance? especially as colours can be recognised at a greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>distance than forms. Many years before Darwin and Mr. Wallace
wrote on this subject, Schopenhauer’s genius anticipated this view
of the matter. “The extremely varied and vivid colours of the
feathers of tropical birds,” he wrote, “have been explained in a
very general way, with reference to their efficient cause, as due to
the strong effect of the tropical light. As their final cause I would
suggest that these brilliant plumes are the gala uniforms by means
of which the species, which are so numerous there and often belonging
to the same genus, recognise each other; so that every male
finds his female. The same is true of the butterflies of different
zones and latitudes” (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Welt als Wille u. V.</cite></span>, ii. 381).</p>

<p class='c001'>Schopenhauer of course errs in attributing, in his ignorance of
Protective, Warning, and other colours, all the hues of birds and
butterflies to this agency. But it is probable that whenever colours
and other ornaments do not serve for purposes of protection (as
<i>e.g.</i> the lion’s mane and the horns of beetles, <i>vide</i> <cite>Tropical Nature</cite>,
p. 202), they serve the purpose of sexual recognition of species.
A case cited by Darwin to prove that quadrupeds take notice of
colour, is very suggestive in this connection: “A female zebra
would not admit the addresses of a male ass until he was painted
so as to resemble a zebra, and then, as John Hunter remarks, she
received him very readily.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is probable, therefore, that in many cases the unique spots
and stripes and colours of animals subserve the special use of
facilitating the finding of a partner; and in this way they relate
directly to the courtship and Romantic Love of animals. Thus
we see how the Love affairs of animals may indirectly affect their
Personal Beauty in a way quite different from that suggested by
Darwin.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>LOVE-CHARMS AND LOVE-CALLS</h3>

<p class='c013'>The same reasoning applies to the music of animals, vocal and
instrumental, on which Darwin lays great stress. In his opinion,
the music of some male animals serves to charm the females
æsthetically, and thus gives to the best musicians special advantages
through Sexual Selection. But the instances cited by him
hardly warrant this conclusion, and seem rather to point to the
inference that the function of animal music is chiefly to facilitate
courtship, by making it easy for the females to discover the whereabouts
of a male of the same species. The evidence tends to show
that it is not the male whose voice is most mellow and melodious
that catches the female, but rather the one who is most vigorous
and persistent and has the loudest organ. As Jaques says in <cite>As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>You Like It</cite>: “Sing it: ’tis no matter how it be in tune, so it
make noise enough!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Darwin himself quotes a naturalist’s statement, that “the
stridulation produced by some of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Locustidæ</i></span> is so loud that it
can be heard during the night at the distance of a mile;” and such
cases as “the drumming of the snipe’s tail, the tapping of the
woodpecker’s beak, the harsh, trumpetlike cry of certain water-fowl,”
though Darwin tries to dispose of them on the ground of a
difference in æsthetic taste, nevertheless incline one to the belief
that the music of the forest troubadours is not so much intended
to gratify the æsthetic taste of the female as to guide her to the
spot where the male awaits her; for, contrary to common opinion,
it is the female in these cases that searches for a male and not <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice
versâ</i></span>. Montagu, for instance, asserts that “males of song-birds
and of many others do not in general search for the female, but, on
the contrary, their business in spring is to perch on some conspicuous
spot, breathing out their full and amorous notes, which, by
instinct, <em>the female knows, and repairs to the spot</em> to choose her
mate.” And Dr. Hartman, speaking of the American <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Cicada
septemdecim</i></span>, says: “The drums are now heard in all directions.
This I believe to be the marital summons from the males. Standing
in thick chestnut sprouts about as high as my head, where
hundreds were around me, I observed the females coming around
the drumming males.” And, says Darwin, “the <em>spel</em> of the blackcock
certainly serves as a call to the female, for it has been known
to bring four or five females from a distance to a male under confinement;
but as the blackcock continues his <em>spel</em> for hours during
successive days, and in the case of the capercailzie ‘with an agony
of passion,’ we are led to suppose that the females which are present
are thus charmed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There appears to be no <em>direct</em> evidence, however, that female
birds are more <em>charmed</em> by one male than another, and prefer him
on account of his superior song, as the theory of Sexual Selection
postulates. And when we remember that likewise there is no
evidence that birds, etc., are ever influenced in their choice by the
superior colours of certain males, and that in fact it is the rule for
the female to follow passively the most vigorous and victorious
male, we are brought back to the conclusion with which we set
out—that it is not the superior songster who wins the female by
charming her, but the loudest and most persistent songster, by
guiding her to the courting-place.</p>

<p class='c001'>Darwin himself evidently felt the weakness of his position, for
he constantly speaks of “love-charms <em>or</em> love-calls” in the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>sentence. Thus, “the true song of most birds and various strange
cries are uttered chiefly during the breeding-season, and serve as a
charm, <em>or merely as a call-note</em>, to the other sex.” Again: “It
is often difficult to conjecture whether the many strange cries and
notes uttered by male birds during the breeding-season serve as a
charm or merely as a call to the female.” The distinction between
love “charms” and mere “calls” is of course of the utmost
importance. For if male song charms the females and influences
them in their choice, we have Sexual-æsthetic-female Selection.
But if the male song merely serves as a call to the female and as
a sign of species-recognition, then Natural Selection accounts for
everything, because the most vigorous, loudest, and most persistent
male will have the choice of the most numerous females brought
to his side by his musical efforts.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>LOVE-DANCES AND DISPLAY</h3>

<p class='c013'>There is one more important link in the chain of Darwin’s
reasoning, which must be broken before his theory of Sexual
Selection can be regarded as demolished. The mad antics of the
blackcock and other birds have been already referred to; and some
of the lower animals seem to endeavour to surpass them, as, for
example, the male alligator, who strives to attract the attention of
the female by splashing and roaring in the water; “swollen to an
extent ready to burst, with its head and tail lifted up, he spins or
twirls round on the surface of the water, like an Indian chief
rehearsing his feats of war.” “To suppose,” says Darwin, “that
the females do not appreciate the beauty of the males, is to
admit that their splendid decorations, all their pomp and display,
are useless; and this is incredible.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But are there no other ways of accounting for all this “pomp
and display”? Certainly, several of them. We have seen that
the most vigorous males are those which are most highly ornamented,
and that it is the vigour and vivacity of the males that
seems to decide the choice of the females where there is any. Now
instinct, <i>i.e.</i> inherited experience, teaches the female the connection
between vigour and display of ornament, and influences her
choice accordingly. Again, the males indulge in their display for
the purpose of arousing the attention of the passive female. This
supposition is rendered the more probable by Darwin’s admission
that “we must be cautious in concluding that the wings are spread
out solely for display, as some birds do so whose wings are not
beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>A third motive of display is the need of finding an outlet for
overflowing nervous energy and excitement. To this Mr. Wallace
refers as follows: “At pairing time the male is in a state of excitement
and full of exuberant energy. Even unornamented birds
flutter their wings or spread them out, erect their tails or crests,
and thus give vent to the nervous excitability with which they are
overcharged.” “It is not improbable,” he continues,—and this
suggests a fourth use of display—"that crests and other erectile
feathers may be primarily of use in <em>frightening away enemies</em>,
since they are generally erected when angry or during combat."</p>

<p class='c001'>A fifth motive of display is suggested by an analogy furnished
by human butterflies and birds of Paradise. Among animals
where the sexes differ, it is commonly the male who is adorned the
most. With us it is the women. But woman’s fineries are not
intended to charm the eyes of men, but to excite one another’s
rivalry and envy. Now it seems that male birds, with whose
plumes our heartless women are so fond of decking themselves, are
guilty of an analogous weakness. They will sometimes display
their ornaments, says Darwin, “when not in the presence of the
females, as occasionally occurs with grouse at their <a id='corr53.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='boly'>holy</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_53.20'><ins class='correction' title='boly'>holy</ins></a></span> places,
and as may be noticed with the peacock; this latter bird, however,
evidently wishes for a spectator of some kind, and, as I have
often seen, will show off his finery before poultry or even pigs.
All naturalists who have closely attended to the habits of birds,
whether in a state of nature or under confinement, are unanimously
of opinion that the males take delight in displaying their <a id='corr53.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='beauty.’'>beauty.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_53.26'><ins class='correction' title='beauty.’'>beauty.”</ins></a></span>
And, once more, “with birds of Paradise a dozen or more full-plumaged
males congregate in a tree to hold a <em>dancing-party</em>, as it
is called by the natives; and here they fly about, raise their wings,
elevate their exquisite plumes, and make them vibrate; and the
whole tree seems, as Mr. Wallace remarks, to be filled with
waving plumes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But if it be the unanimous opinion of naturalists who have
closely studied the habits of birds, “that the males take delight in
displaying their beauty,” why should not the females also take
pleasure in witnessing this display? Perhaps they do, sometimes;
for even Mr. Wallace admits that “the display of the various
ornamental appendages of the male during courtship may be
attractive” to the female. But there is a world-wide difference
between this assertion and the doctrine that the females are so
greatly and so constantly influenced by their æsthetic taste that
they always prefer among males those that are slightly more beautiful
than the others, thus increasing their personal beauty by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>transmission. This is an assumption unsupported by facts, and
rendered unnecessary because Natural Selection accounts for all the
phenomena in question.</p>

<p class='c001'>Admiration of Personal Beauty does not appear, therefore, to
enter noticeably into animal love, except in so far as a slight
amount of æsthetic taste may be admitted in birds. This taste
may be strengthened by the sight of the brilliant masculine ornaments
during the season of love being associated with the
remembered pleasures of courtship.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indirectly, however, female animals promote the cause of beauty
by preferring the more healthy and vigorous individuals, who are
commonly also the most beautiful ones. And is not the same true
of females of the human persuasion, who likewise are much less
influenced in their choice by the beauty than by the boldness,
energy, vivacity, and “manliness” of their suitors? It seems to
hold true throughout nature that the female’s Love is weak in the
æsthetic element, her taste being little developed and too often
neutralised by unconscious utilitarian considerations.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>LOVE AMONG SAVAGES</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>STRANGERS TO LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>In passing from animals to human beings we find at first not
only no advance in the sexual relations, but a decided retrogression.
Among some species of birds, courtship and marriage are
infinitely more refined and noble than among the lowest savages;
and it is especially in their treatment of females, both before and
after mating, that not only birds but all animals show an immense
superiority over primitive man; for male animals only fight
among themselves, and never maltreat the females.</p>

<p class='c001'>This anomaly is easily explained. The intellectual power and
emotional horizon of animals are limited; but in those directions
in which Natural Selection has made them <em>specialists</em>, they reach
a high degree of development, because inherited experience tends
to give to their actions an instinctive or quasi-instinctive precision
and certainty. Among primitive men, on the other hand, reason
begins to encroach more on instinct, but yet in such a feeble way
as to make constant blunders inevitable: thus proving that strong
instincts, combined with a limited intellectual plasticity, are a
safer guide in life than a more plastic but weak intellect minus
the assistance of stereotyped instincts.</p>

<p class='c001'>If neither intellect nor instinct guide the primitive man to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>well-regulated marital relations, such as we find among many
animals, so again his emotional life is too crude and limited to
allow any scope for the domestic affections. Inasmuch as,
according to Sir John Lubbock, gratitude, mercy, pity, chastity,
forgiveness, humility, are ideas or feelings unknown to many or
most savage tribes, we should naturally expect that such a highly-compounded
and ethereal feeling as Romantic Love could not exist
among them. How could Love dwell in the heart of a savage
who baits a fish-hook with the flesh of a child; who eats his wife
when she has lost her beauty and the muscular power which
enabled her to do all his hard work; who abandons his aged
parents, or kills them, and whose greatest delight in life is to kill
an enemy slowly amid the most diabolic tortures?</p>

<p class='c001'>Or how could a primitive girl love a man whose courtship
consists in knocking her on the head and carrying her forcibly
from her own to his tribe? A man who, after a very brief period
of caresses, neglects her, takes perhaps another and younger wife,
and reduces the first one to the condition of a slave, refusing to
let her eat at his table, throwing her bones and remains, as to a
dog, or even driving her away and killing her, if she displeases
him? These are extreme cases, but they are not rare; and in a
slightly modified form they are found throughout savagedom.</p>

<p class='c001'>That Love is a sentiment unknown to savages has been
frequently noted in the works of anthropologists and tourists.
When Ploss remarks that the lowest savages “know as little of
marriage relations as animals; still less do they know the feeling
we call Love,” he does a great injustice to animals, as those who
have read the preceding chapter must admit. <a id='corr55.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Letourneu'>Letourneau</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_55.28'><ins class='correction' title='Letourneu'>Letourneau</ins></a></span>, in his
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Sociologie</cite></span>, remarks: “Among the Cafres Cousas, according to
Lichtenstein, the sentiment of love does not constitute a part of
marriage. ‘The idea of love, as we understand it,’ says Du
Chaillu, in speaking of a tribe of the Gabon, ‘appears to be
unknown to this tribe.’” Monteiro, speaking of the polygamous
tribes of Africa, says: “The negro knows not love, affection, or
jealousy.... In all the long years I have been in Africa I have
never seen a negro manifest the least tenderness for or to a
negress.... I have never seen a negro put his arm round a
woman’s waist, or give or receive any caress whatever that would
indicate the slightest loving regard or affection on either side.
They have no words or expressions in their language indicative of
affection or love.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Spencer, in commenting on this passage, remarks that
“This testimony harmonises with testimonies cited by Sir John
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Lubbock, to the effect that the Hottentots ‘are so cold and
indifferent to one another that you would think there was no such
thing as love between them’; that among the Koussa Kaffirs
there is ‘no feeling of love in marriage’; and that in Yariba, ‘a
man thinks as little of taking a wife as of cutting an ear of corn—affection
is altogether out of the question.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Winwood Reade, on the other hand, informed Darwin
that the West Africans “are quite capable of falling in love, and
of forming tender, passionate, and faithful attachments.” And
the anthropologist Waitz, speaking of Polynesia, says that
“examples of real passionate love are not rare, and on the Fiji
Islands it has happened that individuals married against their will
have committed suicide; although this has only happened in the
higher classes.” Unfortunately in these cases we are left in
doubt as to whether the reference is to Conjugal or to Romantic
Love; conjugal attachment, being of earlier growth than
Romantic Love, because the development of the latter was
retarded by the limited opportunities for prolonged Courtship and
free Choice.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>PRIMITIVE COURTSHIP</h3>

<p class='c013'>In his anxiety to find cases of Romantic Love among North
American and other primitive peoples, Waitz is obliged to fall
back on legends of Lovers’ Leaps and Maiden Rocks, and on a
poem about a South American maiden who committed suicide on
her lover’s grave to avoid falling into the hands of the Spaniards.
Legends and poems, unfortunately, do not count for much as
scientific evidence. At the same time, it would doubtless be
incorrect to assert on the strength of some of the authorities just
quoted that Love does not exist at all among savages, and therefore
to make the chapter on Love among Savages as brief as that
chapter on Snakes in Ireland. We shall find, on the contrary,
that several of Love’s “overtones” are occasionally present; and
that though full-fledged cupids may never appear with their
poisoned arrows, mischievous <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>amourettes</i></span> sometimes do flit across
the field of vision. For the goddess of Love is ever watchful of
an opportunity for one of her emissaries to bag some game.</p>

<p class='c001'>Romantic Love is dependent on opportunities for Courtship.
Among savages and semi-civilised nations we find three grades of
Courtship—Capture, Purchase, and Service. These must be
briefly examined in turn.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <em>Capture.</em>—One of the most curious features of savage life
is the widely-prevalent custom called by M‘Lennan Exogamy, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>marrying out. This custom compels a man who wishes a wife of
his own to steal or purchase her of another tribe, private marriage
within his own tribe being considered criminal and even punishable
with death. To this rule of Exogamy Sir John Lubbock
traces the origin of Monogamy. In his view women were at first,
like other kinds of property, held in common by the tribe, any
man being any woman’s husband <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad libitum</i></span>. No man could
therefore claim a woman for himself without infringing on the
rights of others. But if he stole a woman from another tribe, she
became his exclusive property, which he had a right to guard
jealously, and to look upon with the Pride of Conquest—a pride,
however, quite distinct from that which intoxicates a civilised
lover when he finds, or fondly imagines, that his goddess <em>has
chosen him</em> among all his rivals. The primitive man’s pride is
more like that of the warrior who wears a large number of scalps
in his belt; and as in his case marriage immediately follows
Capture, this feeling, moreover, belongs more properly to the
sphere of conjugal sentiment than to that of Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>This primitive form of courtship, it is obvious, is very much
ruder than that which prevails in the animal kingdom, where the
males alone maltreat one another, while in this early human
courtship the woman, if she resists, is simply knocked on the
head, and her senseless body carried off to the captor’s tent.
Diefenbach relates concerning the Polynesians that “if a girl was
courted by two suitors, each of them grasped one arm of the
beloved and pulled her toward him; the stronger one got her, but
in some cases not before her limbs had been pulled out of joint.”
And Waitz says that “the girls were commonly abducted by
force, which led frequently to most violent fights, in which the
girl herself was occasionally wounded, or even killed, to prevent
her from falling into the hands of the enemy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. E. B. Tylor, after stating that marriage by Capture may
be seen at the present day among the fierce forest tribes of Brazil,
continues: “Ancient tradition knows this practice well, as where
the men of Benjamin carry off the daughters of Shiloh dancing at
the feast, and in the famous Roman tale of the rape of the
Sabines, a legend putting in historical form the wife-capture which
in Roman custom remained as a ceremony. What most clearly
shows what a recognised old-world custom it was, is its being thus
kept up as a formality where milder manners really prevailed.
It had passed into this state among the Spartans, when Plutarch
says that though the marriage was really by friendly settlement
between the families, the bridegroom’s friends went through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>pretence of carrying off the bride by violence. Within a few
generations the same old habit was kept up in Wales, where the
bridegroom and his friends, mounted and armed as for war, carried
off the bride; and in Ireland they used even to hurl spears at the
bride’s people, though at such a distance that no one was hurt,
except now and then by accident, as happened when one Lord
Howth lost an eye, which mischance seems to have put an end
to this curious relic of antiquity.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Moreover, we are told that “in our own marriages the ‘best
man’ seems originally to have been the chief abettor of the bridegroom
in the act of capture.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In a modified form “wife-capture” cannot be said to be extinct
even in this advanced age. Elopement is the modern name for it
When the parents dissent and the couple are very young, this
climax of courtship doubtless is often reprehensible. But in those
cases where the consent of all parties has been obtained, it ought
to be universally adopted. Sudden flight and an impromptu marriage
would add much to the romance of the honeymoon, and would
enable the bridal couple to avoid the terrors and stupid formalities
of the wedding-day, the anticipation of which is doubtless responsible
for the ever-increasing number of cowardly bachelors in the
world.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <em>Purchase</em> represents a somewhat higher stage of Courtship
than Capture. Like Capture this custom has existed among the
peoples of the five continents, and is still retained in some parts of
Africa and elsewhere. In Holstein, Germany, it prevailed in all
its purity, according to Ploss, till the end of the fifteenth century.
Nor would it be doing facts great violence to class our frequent
money-marriages under this head.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are two grades of the custom of Purchase. In the first
the girl has no choice whatever, but is sold by her father for so
many cows or camels, in some cases to the highest bidder. Among
the Turcomans a wife may be purchased for five camels if she be
a girl, or for fifty if a widow; whereas among the Tunguse a girl
costs one to twenty reindeer, while widows are considerably
cheaper. In the second class of cases the purchased girl is allowed
a certain degree of liberty of choice, as we shall see directly, under
the head of Individual Preference.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <em>Service.</em>—On the custom of securing a wife by means of
services rendered her parents, Mr. Spencer remarks: “The practice
which Hebrew tradition acquaints us with in the case of
Jacob, proves to be a widely-diffused practice. It is general with
the Bhils, Ghonds, and Hill tribes of Nepaul; it obtained in Java
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>before Mahometanism was introduced; it was common in ancient
Peru and Central America; and among sundry existing American
races it still occurs. Obviously, a wife long laboured for is likely
to be more valued than one stolen or bought. Obviously, too, the
period of service, during which the betrothed girl is looked upon
as a future spouse, affords room for the growth of some feeling
higher than the merely instinctive—initiates something approaching
to the courtship and engagement of civilised peoples.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCE</h3>

<p class='c013'>All the cases thus far referred to relate to what might be called
indirect or mediate courtship. When a girl is captured and
knocked on the head she can hardly be said to be courted and consulted
as to her wishes; and the man too, in such cases, owing to
the dangers of the sport, is apt to pay no great attention to
a woman’s looks and accomplishments, but to bag the first one
that comes along. In courtship by Purchase, again, the girl is
rarely consulted as to her own preferences, the addresses being
paid to the father, who invariably selects the wealthiest of the
suitors, and only in rare cases allows the daughter a choice, as
among the Kaffirs if the suitors happen to be equally well off.
And thirdly, in courtship by Service, the suitor’s work is not done
to please the daughter, but to recompense the parents for losing
her.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet there appear to be some instances of real courtship, in the
modern sense of the word, among the lower races, where the lovers
pay their addresses directly to the girl and she chooses or rejects
at will. Thus, among the Orang-Sakai, on the Malayan peninsula,
the following custom prevails, as described by Ploss: “On the
wedding-day, the bride, in presence of her relatives, and those of
her lover, and many other witnesses, is obliged to run into the
forest. After a fixed interval the bridegroom follows and seeks to
catch her. If he succeeds in capturing the bride she becomes his
wife, otherwise he is compelled to renounce her for ever. If therefore
a girl dislikes her suitor, she can easily escape from him
and hide in the forest until the time allowed for his pursuit has
expired.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Darwin remarks, in trying to prove the existence of Sexual
Selection among the lower races, that “in utterly barbarous tribes
the women have more power in choosing, rejecting, and tempting
their lovers, or of afterwards changing their husbands, than might
have been expected;” and he cites the following cases, among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>others: “Amongst the Abipones, a man on choosing a wife, bargains
with the parents about the price. But ‘it frequently
happens that the girl rescinds what has been agreed upon between
the parents and the bridegroom, obstinately rejecting the very
mention of marriage.’ She often runs away, hides herself, and
thus eludes the bridegroom. Captain Musters, who lived with the
Patagonians, says that their marriages are always settled by inclination;
‘if the parents make a match contrary to the daughter’s
will, she refuses, and is never compelled to comply.’ In Tierra del
Fuego a young man first obtains the consent of the parents by doing
them some service, and then he attempts to carry off the girl;
‘but if she is unwilling, she hides herself in the woods until her
admirer is heartily tired of looking for her, and gives up the
pursuit; but this seldom happens.’”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>PERSONAL BEAUTY AND SEXUAL SELECTION</h3>

<p class='c013'>Evidence proving that primitive women are influenced in their
choice of a mate by æsthetic considerations appears to be almost
as scant as among animals. Darwin, however, tries to prove that
men owe their beards to sexual or female selection; and the
following more general instances may be cited for what they are
worth: Azara “describes how carefully a Guana woman bargains
for all sorts of privileges before accepting some one or more
husbands; and the men in consequence take unusual care of their
personal appearance.” Among the Kaffirs “very ugly, though rich
men, have been known to fail in getting wives. The girls, before
consenting to be betrothed, compel the men to show themselves
off first in front and then behind, and ‘exhibit their paces.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>In general, however, it seems that the women choose, not the
handsomest men, but those whose boldness, pugnacity, and virility
promise them the surest protection against enemies, and general
domestic delights. Thus, we read that “before he is allowed to
marry, a young Dyack must prove his bravery by bringing back
the head of an enemy;” and that when the Apaches warriors return
unsuccessful, “the women turn away from them with assured
indifference and contempt. They are upbraided as cowards, or for
want of skill and tact, and are told that such men should not have
wives.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It must be remembered, however, that (as we have seen in the
case of plants and animals) the greatest amount of health, vigour,
and courage generally coincide with the greatest physical beauty;
hence the continued preference of the most energetic and lusty men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>by the superior women who have a choice, has naturally tended to
evolve a superior type of manly beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the case of men it seems much more probable that they
frequently select their wives in accordance with an æsthetic standard.
The chiefs of almost every tribe throughout the world have
more than one wife; and Mr. Mantell informed Darwin that until
recently almost every girl in New Zealand who was pretty, or
promised to be pretty, was <em>tapu</em> to some chief; while among the
Kaffirs, according to Mr. C. Hamilton, “the chiefs generally have
the pick of the women for many miles round, and are most
persevering in establishing or confirming their privilege.” In
the lower tribes, where “communal marriage” and marriage
by Capture alone prevail, æsthetic choice is of course out of the
question, and cannot make its appearance till we come to less
pugnacious tribes, such as the Dyacks, whose children “have the
freedom implied by regular courtship,” or the Samoans, whose children
“have the degree of independence implied by elopements when
they cannot obtain parental assent to their marriage” (Spencer).</p>

<p class='c001'>In general, however, among the lower races, Sexual or æsthetic
Selection leads to sorry results, owing to the bad taste of the
selectors. The standard of primitive taste is not harmonious proportion
and capacity for expression, but Exaggeration. The negro
woman has naturally thicker lips, more prominent cheek-bones,
and a flatter nose than a white woman; and in selecting a mate,
preference is commonly given to the one whose lips are thickest,
nose most flattened, and cheek-bones most prominent: thus producing
gradually that monster of ugliness—the average negro
woman. What right we have to set ourselves up as judges, and
claim that our taste is superior to the negro’s, is a question which
will be discussed in a subsequent section of this treatise.</p>

<p class='c001'>One other point, however, may be referred to here, namely,
that although the æsthetic overtone of Love—the Admiration of
Personal Beauty—may enter into a savage’s amorous feelings, it is
only the sensuous aspect of it that affects him, the intellectual
and moral sides being unknown to him. His admiration is purely
physical. He marries his chosen bride when she is a mere child,
and before the slightest spark of mental charm can illumine her
features and impart to them a superior beauty; and subsequently,
when experience has somewhat sharpened her intellectual powers,
hard labour has already destroyed all traces of her physical beauty
so that the combination of physical and mental charms which
alone can inspire the highest form of Love is never to be found in
primitive woman.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>JEALOUSY AND POLYGAMY</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The moral mission of Jealousy, as stated on a preceding page,
is, by means of watchfulness and the inspiring of fear, to ensure
fidelity and chastity. Darwin says that from the strength of the
feeling of jealousy all through the animal kingdom, as well as
from the analogy of the lower animals, especially those which
come nearest to man, he “cannot believe that absolutely promiscuous
intercourse prevailed in times past, shortly before man
attained to his present rank in the zoological scale.” This may be
true, yet it is astonishing to find how many of the lower tribes
are utterly unconcerned regarding the morals both of married and
unmarried women. A vast number of cases illustrating this
absence of jealousy are collected in Waitz’s <cite>Anthropology</cite>, Spencer’s
<cite>Sociology</cite>, the works of Lubbock, and especially in Ploss’s <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Das
Weib</cite></span>, i. 205-214. In some cases girls are allowed to do as they
please until after marriage, when they are jealously guarded; in
other cases the reverse is true. In some parts of Africa a breach
of faith on the wife’s part is regarded as an attack not on the
husband’s honour but on his property; hence a pecuniary compensation
is all that is required. Lubbock enumerates a large
number of races among whom the lending of a wife or daughter is
a common and obligatory form of hospitality. And the Chibchas
of South America went so far in their indifference to virginity
that they considered a virgin bride to be unfortunate, “as she had
not inspired affection in men.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Jealousy for the possession of a woman, however, was much
sooner developed than jealous regard for her conduct. The statement
of Sir John Lubbock about the men of an Indian tribe, that
they “fight for the possession of the women, just like stags,” and
similar statements regarding other savages, imply that, just like
stags, these men feel the pangs of primitive Jealousy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among polygamous nations the women, too, often fight for the
men, whose favourites in their absence are apt to suffer much at
the hands of jealous rivals. It is among the polygamous semi-civilised
nations in general that Jealousy asserts itself in the most
shrill and dissonant manner. It is not that bitter-sweet romantic
Jealousy which by its constant fluctuations between hope and
doubt fans a modern lover’s passion into brighter flames; it is a
more vicious kind of conjugal Jealousy which destroys domestic
peace and plots the ruin of rivals. In Madagascar, Mr. Spencer
tells us, “the name for Polygyny—‘fampovafesana’—signifies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>‘the means of causing <a id='corr63.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='enmity’'>enmity’”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_63.1'><ins class='correction' title='enmity’'>enmity’”</ins></a></span>; and that kindred names are
commonly applicable to it we are shown by their use among the
Hebrews: in the Mishna a man’s several wives are called ‘tzârot,’
that is, troubles, adversaries, or rivals. In modern Persia, where
polygamy prevails, the same state of affairs is encountered. Says
Ploss: “If there are several women in the house, each one inhabits
a separate division; in the houses of the wealthy each
wife, moreover, has her own servants. Constantly apprehending
evil intentions, no woman touches the dishes of a rival.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is among the polygamous nations of the East, too, that
history records such a profusion of bloody wars of succession
waged by half-brothers; for how could fraternal or any other
kind of domestic affection flourish in families where the mothers
are constantly goaded by Jealousy into deadly hatred of one
another?</p>

<h3 class='c014'>MONOPOLY AND MONOGAMY</h3>

<p class='c013'>The United States being a “free country,” its government
has sometimes been blamed by “freethinkers” for attempting to
repress Mormon Polygamy. But a free country is not one in
which social experiments injurious to public welfare are to be
necessarily allowed. Readers of history and anthropology know
that polygamy is an experiment which has been tried so often
with disastrous social results, that it may be looked upon safely
as criminal and treated accordingly. Even the forcible argument
of that spiteful old pessimist, Schopenhauer, that polygamy should
be introduced because it would rid the world of old maids, does
not save the institution; since it is well—for the prospects of
Beauty, at any rate—that some women should be “eliminated”
in the form of old maids.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the causes which tended to make polygamy the commonest
form of marriage among savages, four may be briefly
enumerated: (1) The constant wars among the tribes decimated
the men, leaving a larger proportion of women than men, although
this was to some extent neutralised by the habit of female infanticide,
which the women indulged in to make themselves more
cherished through scarcity and, possibly, to preserve their beauty;
(2) The women being commonly secured as booty in war, it was
naturally looked on as an honour and a sign of valour to have
more than one wife; (3) Women being regarded and treated as
slaves, the more a man had of them the more they could, by their
combined labour, increase his wealth and influence in the tribe;
(4) The rapid decay of the youthful beauty of primitive woman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>naturally inclined her husband, whose affection was solely based
on those physical charms, to add a second or third, younger woman
to his harem.</p>

<p class='c001'>As woman’s position improved with advancing civilisation,
these influences favouring polygamy were gradually weakened;
and as in treating of Love among Animals, we found the most
remarkable instances of affection—conjugal and romantic—among
birds, who are mostly monogamous; so, among the lower races of
man, monogamy is commonly a sign of superior culture and higher
development of the affections. And this might have been foreseen
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span>, inasmuch as <a id='corr64.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='monogomy'>monogamy</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_64.11'><ins class='correction' title='monogomy'>monogamy</ins></a></span> is the only marital relation compatible
with that Monopoly of affection which is one of the conditions
of Romantic Love. How could a man feel an exclusive
amorous interest in his bride, knowing that in a few months or
years another would come to claim half his interest? or how
could the bride concentrate all her Love on a man of whom she
knew that he could give her only half or a smaller fraction of his
affection?</p>

<p class='c001'>A similar view is taken by Mr. Spencer. Monogamic unions,
he says, “tend in no small degree indirectly to raise the quality of
adult life, by giving a permanent and deep source of æsthetic
interest. On recalling the many and keen pleasures derived from
music, poetry, fiction, the drama, etc.; and on remembering that
their predominant theme is the passion of love, we shall see that
to monogamy, which has developed this passion, we owe a large
part of the gratifications which fill our leisure hours.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>PRIMITIVE COYNESS</h3>

<p class='c013'>Among the Samoiedes, says Klemm, “a man purchases a wife
for a number of reindeer, varying from five to twenty; the bride,
as is the case also in Greenland, struggles violently against leaving
the paternal house, and commonly she has to be caught forcibly
and bound on the bridegroom’s sledge.” In some of the Bedouin
tribes the destined bride runs from tent to tent to escape being
brought to the bridegroom. When an Esquimaux girl is asked in
marriage, says Kranz (quoted by Mr. Spencer), she “directly falls
into the greatest apparent consternation and runs out of doors,
tearing her bunch of hair; for single women always affect the
utmost bashfulness and aversion to any proposal of marriage, lest
they should lose their reputation for modesty.” So among the
Bushmen a lover’s attentions “are received with an affectation of
great alarm and disinclination on her part”; while an Arab bride
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“defends herself with stones, and often inflicts wounds on the
young men, even though she does not dislike the lover; for
according to custom, the more she struggles, bites, kicks, cries,
and strikes, the more she is applauded ever after by her own
companions.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Obviously these glacier, forest, and desert belles have a somewhat
cruder way than our city belles of hiding their feelings.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Spencer refers to the Coyness of these maidens as one
motive or cause of wife-capture, but he does not inquire into the
origin of Coyness itself, which is a much more interesting point in
the psychology of Love. The fear “lest they should lose their
reputation for modesty,” mentioned above, is the most obvious
cause of this exaggerated resistance, as it is of the excessive
prudishness often encountered in some European civilised countries
of to-day. Again, the sight of the harsh treatment to which her
married sisters or friends are subjected, would make the primitive
bride naturally averse to exchange her maiden freedom for conjugal
slavery.</p>

<p class='c001'>It seems, however, that in most cases, the Coyness is less real
than simulated; and for this form of Coyness—reversing Mr.
Spencer’s reasoning—we may say that Exogamy, or Capture, is
responsible. For since Capture implies courage and valour on the
part of the husband, it may have been to secure the “prestige of
a foreign marriage”—as fashionable novelists would say—that the
form of Capture was imitated in cases where there was no opposition,
either on the part of the girl or her parents.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another explanation of sham Coyness is afforded by the following
case: Among the inhabitants of the Volga region, in Russia,
the bride is occasionally captured and carried off, though here too
there is no opposition on her part or from her parents. The cause
of this procedure is the desire to avoid the expenses of the marriage
ceremony, which in that region are out of all proportion to the
means of the lower classes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Finally it may be suggested that Coyness, so far as it really
exists in the primitive maiden, owes its origin to the instinctive
perception that the men value them more if they do not throw
themselves into their arms on the first impulse. And more than
anything else, this attitude of reserve feeds the flames of Romantic
Love by transferring its delights and pangs to the imagination.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet, after all, manifestations of Coyness must be the exception
and not the rule in the lower races, inasmuch as in the vast
majority of cases, where no choice is allowed the bride, there is
little or no opportunity for the exercise of such a trait.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Of <span class='sc'>Gallantry</span> I have not succeeded in discovering any traces
in the records of savage life, except possibly in the case of the
natives of Kamtchatka, where the wooer has to go into service for
his bride, and during this time endeavours constantly to lighten
her labours and make himself agreeable to her. So far as Gallantry
occurs, it is more likely to be a feminine trait—as among one of
the North American Indian tribes, where the maiden cooks her
suitor’s game, and sends him back the best morsels with presents;
or as with another tribe, the Osages, where the maidens pay court
to the warriors by offering them ears of corn.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for the remaining characters of Romantic Love, which
require a vivid imagination and persistent emotions for their realisation,
it would be useless to look for them in Savagedom—except
perhaps in those infinitesimal proportions in which various chemical
substances are found by analysts in mineral waters. The following
may be offered as an approximate list of the ingredients in the
Love of savage and semi-civilised peoples:—</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CAN AMERICAN NEGROES LOVE?</h3>

<p class='c013'>It is a very interesting question how far the negroes transplanted
to America, who have adopted so many of the habits and
ways of thinking of their white neighbours, are capable of forming
a true romantic attachment, characterised by the various traits
described in this work. I have not been able to find any conclusive
evidence on this head; and should any readers of this book
positively know any cases, I should be greatly obliged if they
would forward a detailed account of them to me, in care of the
publisher.</p>

<p class='c001'>As regards a negro’s capacity for falling in Love with a white
woman, the following interesting communication<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a> appeared in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span><cite>New York Nation</cite>, 12th February 1885: “In corroboration of
‘Bill Arp’s’ view, referred to in No. 1020 of the <cite>Nation</cite>, that
negroes, as a race, do not desire to ‘mix’ with the white race, I
may cite a remark recently made by a negro carpenter to a friend
of mine. The latter said to him, as a village belle passed them
on the street, ‘Charles, don’t you think that’s a very handsome
young lady?’ ‘I reckon so,’ he answered doubtfully, and immediately
added, ‘Fact is, boss, us coloured folks don’t think white
ladies handsome; we like ’em coloured the best.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“Had it been otherwise there would, doubtless, have been
innumerable instances, in the North as well as at the South, of
love-longings on the part of negro men toward girls of the dominant
race. Yet during all the years I have spent in the Southern
States, I never knew or heard of any instances of this kind, and
their exceptional character in the North must be known to all
your readers. The hopelessness of such attachments would, of
course, diminish their number; but fancy is always free, and
‘hopeless attachments’ among members of the same race are as
common now as when Petrarch sighed for Laura, and Tasso wrote
‘The throne of Cupid has an easy stair,’ himself having climbed it
uninspired by hope. The existence of many persons of mixed
blood throughout the country affords no proof that the two races
feel toward each other the attraction of love; for the fathers, in
these cases, are almost invariably white, and the offspring cannot
be called ‘love-children,’ but the fruit of mere passion linked with

  <h2 class='c005'>HISTORY OF LOVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It would be a profitless task to hunt for the first traces of the
various elements of Love in the records of all the nations of
antiquity; for we meet almost everywhere with the same old story
of Romantic Love impeded in its growth or its very existence by
the degraded position of women, and by the absence of opportunities
for courtship, and for free matrimonial choice. A few
remarks, however, must be made concerning Love among the
ancient Egyptians, Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, and our Aryan
kinsfolk in India, before passing on to Mediæval and Modern
Love.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>LOVE IN EGYPT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Georg Ebers, the Leipzig professor, and author of the
popular series of historic Egyptian novels, remarks that “if it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>true that a nation’s degree of culture can be estimated by the more
or less favourable position accorded its women, then Egyptian
culture ranks above that of all other ancient peoples.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The women of ancient Egypt were not kept in seclusion like
those of Greece. They did their own marketing, and had other
domestic and public liberties and privileges which astonished the
Greek historian Herodotus, who also mentions that although
polygamy was tolerated among them, monogamy was the rule.
Inasmuch as the Egyptians had an advanced culture, invented
many arts, promoted the sciences, and were industrial rather than
militant in their occupations, it is possible that several of the more
refined elements of Romantic Love may have existed among them;
for just as we have seen that some animals have higher notions of
love, conjugal and romantic, than some savages, although the
latter represent a later stage of evolution, so it seems probable
that among the nations of antiquity Love did not progress steadily,
year by year; but that some nations had more and some less of
it; while the acquisitions of one period may have been lost in evil
and corrupt times following, as was certainly the case in India.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since we have no such extensive literature of Egypt as we have
of the Greeks, Romans, and Hebrews, it is not easy to arrive at
definite conclusions. But the Egyptian custom of forming “trial
marriages” for one year, and the ease with which a husband could
divorce and expel his wife by simply pronouncing three words in
her presence do not harmonise with our modern notions of Love.
How scornfully a modern Romeo would reject the very notion of
such a trial-marriage! for does he not feel <em>absolutely</em> certain that
his Love is eternal and unalterable?</p>

<p class='c001'>The institution of trial-marriages seems to point to the conclusion
that the Egyptians, like the Greeks, looked upon marriage primarily
as a means of augmenting the family and the state, and not as a
union of loving souls—children or no children—which is the
modern ideal.</p>

<p class='c001'>Professor Ebers of course has a right to make use of a poetic
license in painting the Love affairs of his Egyptian heroes and
heroines in modern colours, as Shakspere does in <cite>Antony and
Cleopatra</cite>. At the same time it would give an added flavour to
historic romances if their pictures of domestic and public life were
characterised by <em>emotional realism</em> as well as by general antiquarian
accuracy. The elaborate analysis of Love, for the first time
attempted in the present monograph, should facilitate this task
for novelists.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>ANCIENT HEBREW LOVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It is almost startling to find, on consulting a Concordance of
the Old and New Testaments, that in the whole of the Bible there
is not a single reference to Romantic Love. Had this sentiment
existed among the ancient Hebrews as it does among their
descendants to-day, it is obvious that it could not possibly have
been ignored in the Book of Books, which so eloquently and
poetically discourses of everything else that is of vital interest to
man. Conjugal Love (which apparently antedates Romantic Love
in every nation) is indeed repeatedly referred to and enjoined, as
well as the other family affections; but in the remaining cases the
word Love is always used in the sense of religious veneration, or
of regard for a neighbour or an enemy.</p>

<p class='c001'>This absence of any reference to Romantic Love is all the more
surprising in view of the fact that among the ancient Hebrews
woman was held more in honour than with any other Oriental
nation, ancient or modern. Thus we are told in M‘Clintock and
Strong’s <cite>Cyclopædia of Biblical etc. Literature</cite>, that “the seclusion
of the harem and the habits consequent upon it were utterly
unknown in early times, and the condition of the Oriental woman,
as pictured to us in the Bible, contrasts most favourably with that
of her modern representative. There is abundant evidence that
women, whether married or unmarried, went about with their faces
unveiled. An unmarried woman might meet and converse with
men, even strangers, in a public place; she might be found alone
in the country without any reflection on her character; or she
might appear in a court of justice.” The wife “entertained guests
at her own desire in the absence of her husband, and sometimes
even in defiance of his wishes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Since, therefore, the Hebrew woman was not “the husband’s
slave but his companion,” how are we to account for the absence
of Love?</p>

<p class='c001'>Some light is thrown on the matter by the prevalence of polygamy,
which, as we have seen, is inimical to the growth of Love.
Polygamy, though not universal, was sanctioned by the Mosaic
law, except in the case of priests. “The secondary wife was
regarded by the Hebrews as a wife, and her rights were secured by
law.” In the cases of Abraham and Jacob, polygamy was resorted
to at the request of their own wives, “under the idea that children
born to a slave were in the eye of the law the children of the
mistress.” Now if a woman advises her own husband to take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>another wife, there must be a total absence of Jealousy and Monopoly—the
two elements of Romantic Love which pass into conjugal
affection without diminution of force.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, although Hebrew women are said to have had considerable
liberty of going about alone in town and country, this
probably refers in most cases to the privilege of tending sheep and
of fetching water at the well. “From all education in general,”
says Ploss, “as well as <em>from social intercourse with men, woman
was excluded</em>; her destination being simply to increase the number
of children, and take care of household matters. She lived a quiet
life, merely for her husband, who, indeed, treated her with respect
and consideration, but without feeling any special tenderness
toward her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is the line which I have italicised in the above quotation
that suggests the principal reason of the non-existence of Love in
Biblical times: There were no meetings of the young, no opportunities
for Courtship, the indispensable condition of Love, which
requires time and opportunity for its growth. And not only were
there no regular opportunities for Courtship, but if they offered
themselves casually, the young folks could not derive much benefit,
from them; for not only the daughter’s choice, but even the son’s
was neutralised by the parental command. “Fathers from the
beginning considered it both their duty and prerogative to find or
select wives <em>for their sons</em> (Gen. xxiv. 3; xxxviii. 6). In the
absence of the father, the selection devolved upon the mother
(Gen. xxi. 21). Even in cases where the wishes of the son were
consulted, the proposals were made by the father (Gen. xxxiv. 4,
8); and the violation of this parental prerogative on the part of
the son was ‘a grief of mind’ to the father (Gen. xxvi. 35). The
proposals were generally made by the parents of the young man,
except when there was a difference of rank, in which case the
negotiations proceeded from the father of the maiden (Exod. ii.
21), and when accepted by the parents on both sides, sometimes
also consulting the opinion of the adult brothers of the maiden
(Gen. xxiv. 51; xxxiv. 11), the matter was considered as settled,
<em>without requiring the consent of the bride</em>” (M‘Clintock and
Strong).</p>

<p class='c001'>But how about the Song of Solomon—the Song of Songs? Is
not that a song of Love, and an exception to our general statement?
It appears so at first sight; and the German writer
Herder, in his detailed and glowing analysis of it, declares that it
depicts love “from its first origin, from its tenderest bud, through
all stages and conditions of its growth, its flowering, its maturing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>to the ripe fruit and new offshoot.” Herder, however, is a very
unsafe and shallow guide in this matter. An attempt has lately
been made to rehabilitate him in Germany, where his fame has
become almost extinct; but in vain, for his pompous, stilted
rhetoric and imagery cannot conceal from modern readers his lack
of ideas and limited knowledge of facts. He asserts that, as there
is only one Goodness, one Truth, so there is but one Love (or
Affection). If you do not love your wife, he says, you will not
love your friend, parents, or child. A writer whose notions of the
psychology of love are so excessively crude cannot be considered a
trustworthy judge in the matter in question. So far as love is
referred to in the Song of Solomon, it is probable that conjugal
affection is meant.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a curious fact that of the famous German, English, and
French theologians who have written commentaries on the Song of
Songs, no two seem to agree in their interpretation of its plot and
significance. It is now generally agreed, too, that the Song was
not written by Solomon, but some time after him. It seems,
indeed, incredible that a monarch who had a thousand wives, and
whose affections must have been torn into a thousand shreds, and
cannot have been very lasting, should have written these marvellous
lines: “For love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave:
the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement
flame. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods
drown it: if a man should give all the substance of his house for
love, it would utterly be contemned.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This passage has a remarkably modern and romantic sound—so
modern and romantic that it would not seem out of place in Shakspere.
But it needs no knowledge of Hebrew to see that the
responsibility for this modern sound rests with the English translators.
Luther’s more literal version appears much less modern.
Indeed, throughout the Song of Solomon the English translators
have idealised the language of passion, in harmony with modern
notions on the subject; so that it is only on reading Luther’s
version that one begins to understand why the Talmudists did not
allow the Jews to read this book before their thirtieth year.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps the most ingenious and consistent of the numerous
interpretations of the Song of Solomon is that given by M. Chas.
Bruston in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Encyclopædie des Sciences Religieuses</cite></span> (ii. 610-612).
The repetition of the flatteries occurring in the poem he
explains by showing that the second time they refer, not to the
Sulamite, but to a princess of Lebanon whom Solomon married.
Hence, he insists, the repetition is not so much a literary blemish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>as an indication <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“combien est vil et méprisable l’amour sensuel et
polygame, qui prodigue indifférement les mêmes flatteries a des
femmes différentes.”</span></p>

<p class='c001'>The imaginative and poetic terms in which feminine charms
are depicted in the Song of Songs show that, nevertheless, at least
the sensuous phase of the overtone of Personal Admiration was
strongly developed among the ancient Hebrews; not strongly
enough, however, to lead them, as it led other ancient nations, to
embody their ideals of feminine and masculine beauty in marble
monuments of sculpture.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>ANCIENT ARYAN LOVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>As it is among the Aryan or “Indo-Germanic” races of Europe
and America that Modern Love has produced its most beautiful
blossoms, it is, even more than in the case of the non-Aryan Jews
and Egyptians, of interest to know something concerning its
prevalence among the Asiatic peoples who appear as the nearest
modern representatives of our remote Aryan ancestors.</p>

<p class='c001'>In no country, perhaps, has the position of woman differed so
greatly at various epochs as in India. Previous to the introduction
of Brahminism, women were held in esteem, enjoyed diverse
privileges, and were allowed free social intercourse with the men,
while monogamy was the recognised form of marriage. The
Brahmins, however, introduced polygamy, setting a good example
by sometimes marrying a whole family, “old and young, daughters,
aunts, sisters, and cousins”; and one case is known of a Brahmin
who had 120 wives, according to Schweiger Lerchenfeld. Family
feeling was subordinated to considerations of caste, and by a
sophistical interpretation of ancient laws the Brahmins introduced
the custom of Suttee, or the burning alive of widows on the
deceased husband’s funeral pyre. This habit is sometimes
regarded as the very apotheosis of conjugal affection, but it was
simply what is known in modern psychology as an epidemic
delusion; the poor women being rendered willing to sacrifice
themselves by the doctrine that to die in this way was something
specially voluptuous and meritorious; while those who refused to
be immolated were treated as social outcasts who were not allowed
to marry again or to adorn their persons in any way.</p>

<p class='c001'>The references to women in the laws of Manu show in what
low esteem they came to be held in India. A few of the maxims
contained in this work may be cited: “Of dishonour woman is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>the cause; of enmity woman is the cause; of mundane existence
woman is the cause; hence woman is to be avoided.” “A girl,
a maiden, a wife shall never do anything in accordance with her
own will, not even in her own house.” “A woman shall serve
her husband all life long, and remain true to him even after
death; even though he should deceive her, love another, and be
devoid of good qualities, a good wife should nevertheless revere
him as if he were a god; she must not displease him in anything,
neither in life nor after his death.” So wretched, indeed, became
woman’s lot that Indian mothers, it is said, “often drown their
female children in the sacred streams of India, to preserve them
from the fate awaiting them in life.” Letourneau states that
“up to modern times Hindoo laws and manners have been
modelled after the sacred precepts. When Somerat made his
voyage, it was considered improper for a respectable woman to
know how to read or dance. These futile accomplishments were
left to the courtesan, the Bayadere.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>HINDOO LOVE MAXIMS</h3>

<p class='c013'>That such a state of affairs was not favourable to Romantic
Love is obvious. Nevertheless there appears to have been a
period—about 1200 or 1500 years ago—when some of the
inhabitants of India were familiar with most of the emotions
which enter into Modern Love. This evidence is contained in the
<cite>Seven Hundred Maxims of Hâla</cite>, a collection of poetic utterances
dating back not further than the third century of our era, and
comprising productions by various authors, including as many as
sixteen of the female persuasion. They are written in a sister-language
of Sanscrit, the Prâkrit; and their form indicates that
they were intended to be sung. Herr Albrecht Weber remarks in
the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Deutsche Rundschau</cite></span> with reference to this collection: “At
the very beginning of our acquaintance with Sanscrit literature,
towards the end of the last century, it was noticed, and was
claimed forthwith as an eloquent proof of antique relationship,
that Indian poetry, especially of the amatory kind, is in character
remarkably allied to our own modern poetry. The sentimental
qualities of modern verse, in one word, were traced in Indian
poetry in a much higher degree than they had been found in
Greek and Roman literature; and this discovery awakened at
once, notably in Germany, a sympathetic interest in a country
whose poets spoke a language so well known to our hearts, as
though they had been born among ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Some of these maxims apparently depict the family life of the
lower classes; others appear rather as if they had been intended
to be sung by the Bayaderes, or singing and dancing girls of the
Buddhist temples, who emancipated themselves from the domestic
and educational restrictions placed on other women, and sought to
fascinate men with their wit, love, and æsthetic accomplishments.
This suggestion is borne out by the fact that most of the maxims
are feminine utterances, and often of questionable moral character.
Although, therefore, some of these revelations of early Aryan Love
have an unpleasant by-flavour, they are yet extremely interesting
as showing how dependent Romantic Love is on the freedom and
the intellectual and æsthetic culture of woman.</p>

<p class='c001'>We find in the maxims of Halâ evidences of that important
overtone of Love, Ecstatic Adoration or Poetic Hyperbole, which
we have not encountered elsewhere, so far. What could be more
modern than this:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Although all my possessions were burnt in the village fire,
yet is my heart delighted, since <em>he</em> took the buckets from me
when they were passed from hand to hand.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Or this:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“O thou who art skilled in cookery, restrain thy anger! The
reason why the fire refuses to burn, and only smokes, is that it
may the longer drink in the breath of your mouth, fragrant as the
red potato-blossoms.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The following two show how Personal Beauty was appreciated:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“He sees nothing but her face, and she too is quite intoxicated
by his looks. Both, satisfied with each other, act as if in the
whole world there were no other women or men.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Other beauties likewise have in their faces beautiful, wide
black eyes, with long lashes,—but no one else understands as she
does how to use them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>How Love establishes his Monopoly in heart and mind,
tolerating no other thought, is thus shown:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“She stares without a (visible) object, draws a deep sigh,
laughs into empty space, mutters unintelligible words—forsooth,
there must be something on her heart.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ovid himself might have written the following, showing
Love’s inconstancy:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Love departs when lovers are separated; it departs when
they see too much of each other; it departs in consequence of
malicious gossip; aye, it departs also without these causes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The nature of Coyness is evidently understood, for the lover is
thus admonished:—</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“My son, such is the nature of love, suddenly to get angry, to
make up again in a moment, to dissemble its language, to tease
immoderately.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And yet the poet deems it necessary to tell a sweetheart
that—</p>

<p class='c001'>“By forgiving him at first sight, you foolish girl, you deprived
yourself of many pleasures,—of his prostration at your feet
[a trace of Gallantry], of a kiss passionately stolen.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The sadness of separation thus finds utterance:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“As is sickness without a physician; as living with relatives
when one is poor,—as the sight of an enemy’s prosperity,—so is
it difficult to endure separation from you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus we find in Ancient Aryan Love some of the leading
features of modern romantic passion.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>GREEK LOVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Greeks, too, were Aryans, and they were the most refined
and æsthetic nation of antiquity; yet we look in vain in their
literature for delineations of that Romantic Love which, according
to our notions, ought to accompany so high a degree of culture.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>FAMILY AFFECTIONS</h3>

<p class='c013'>Conjugal tenderness and the other family affections appear;
indeed, to have been known and cherished by the Greeks at all
times, in the days of Athenian supremacy, when women were kept
in entire seclusion, no less than in Homeric times, when they seem
to have enjoyed more liberty of action. Plutarch tells us in his
<cite>Conjugal Precepts</cite> that “With women tenderness of heart is indicated
by a pleasing countenance, by sweetness of speech, by an
affectionate grace, and by a high degree of sensitiveness;” and Mr.
Lecky thus eloquently sums up the evidence that the Greeks
appreciated the various forms of domestic affection:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“The types of female excellence which are contained in the
Greek poems, while they are among the earliest, are also among
the most perfect in the literature of mankind. The conjugal tenderness
of Hector and Andromache; the unwearied fidelity of
Penelope, awaiting through the long revolving years the return of
her storm-tossed husband, who looked forward to her as the crown
of all his labours; the heroic love of Alcestis, voluntarily dying
that her husband might live; the filial piety of Antigone; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>majestic grandeur of the death of Polyxena; the more subdued
and saintly resignation of Iphigenia, excusing with her last breath
the father who had condemned her; the joyous, modest, and
loving Nausicaa, whose figure shines like a perfect idyll among the
tragedies of the <cite>Odyssey</cite>—all these are pictures of perennial beauty,
which Rome and Christendom, chivalry and modern civilisation,
have neither eclipsed nor transcended. Virgin modesty and
conjugal fidelity, the graces as well as the virtues of the most
perfect womanhood, have never been more exquisitely portrayed.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>NO LOVE-STORIES</h3>

<p class='c013'>But Mr. Lecky, ignoring, like most writers, the enormous
difference between conjugal and romantic love, forgets to notice
the absolute silence of Greek literature on the subject of pre-matrimonial
infatuation. Not one of the Greek tragedies is a
“love-drama”; romantic love does not appear even in the writings
of Euripides, who has so much to say about women, and who
named most of his plays after his heroines. Had Love been
known to Sophokles and Euripides, as it was known to Shakspere
and Goethe, we should no doubt have a Greek <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>
and a Greek <cite>Faust</cite>. For although there were certain limitations
as to the scope and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dramatis personæ</i></span> of a Greek play, there
was nothing whatever to exclude a love-story. And when we
consider how the sentiment of Love colours all modern literature;
how almost impossible it is for a play or a novel to succeed unless
it embodies a love-story: the absolute ignoring of this passion in
Greek literature forces on us the inevitable conclusion that
Romantic Love was unknown to them, or only so faintly
developed as to excite no interest whatever.</p>

<p class='c001'>And this conclusion harmonises with the dictum of the best
Greek scholars. It is true that Becker, in his <cite>Charikles</cite>, referring
to the frequency with which the comedians introduce a youth
desperately enamoured of a girl, faintly objects to the statement
that “There is no instance of an Athenian falling in love with a
free-born woman, and marrying her from violent passion,”—made
by Müller in his famous work on the Dorians. But he makes the
fatal admission that “Sensuality was the soil from which such
passion sprang, and none other than a sensual love was acknowledged
between man and wife.” No one, of course, would deny
that sensual passion prevailed in Athens; but sensuality is the
very antipode of Romantic Love.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>WOMAN’S POSITION</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>How are we to account for this anomaly—the absence of sexual
romance in a nation which was so passionately enamoured of
Beauty in its various forms?</p>

<p class='c001'>The answer is to be found in the non-existence of opportunities
for courtship, and the degraded position of woman. The following
sentences, culled at random from Becker’s classical work, show how
the Greek men regarded their women, whom they considered inferior
to themselves in heart as well as in intellect. Iphigenia
herself is made to admit by Euripides that one man is worth more
than a myriad of women:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>εἶς γ’ ανὴρ κρείσσων γυναικῶν μυρίων.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“The ἀρετή (virtue) of which a woman was thought capable in
that age differed but little from that of a faithful slave.” “Except
in her own immediate circle, a woman’s existence was scarcely
recognised.” “It was quite a Grecian view of the case to consider
a wife as a necessary evil.” "Athenians, in speaking of their
wives and children, generally said τέκνα καὶ γυναῖκας, putting
their wives last: a phrase which indicates very clearly what was
the tone of feeling on this subject" (Smith).</p>

<p class='c001'>Women “were not allowed to conclude any bargain or transaction
of consequence on their own account,” though Plato urged
that this concession should be made to them; and it was even
“enacted that everything a man did by the counsel or request of
a woman should be null.” “There were no educational institutions
for girls, nor any private teachers at home.” “Hence there
were no scientifically-learned ladies, with the exception of the
Hetæræ.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPERONAGE <i>VERSUS</i> COURTSHIP</h3>

<p class='c013'>In such an arid, rocky soil Love of course could not grow or
even germinate. Still more fatal to the romantic passion, however,
was the absolute seclusion of the sexes, precluding all possibility
of courtship and free choice among the young. Greek women
were not allowed to enjoy the society of men, nor to attend “those
public spectacles which were the chief means of Athenian culture,”
and which would have afforded the young folks an opportunity of
seeing and falling in love with one another. The wife was not
even permitted to eat with her husband if male visitors were
present, but had to retire to her private apartments, so absurd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>was the jealousy of the men. “The maidens lived in the greatest
seclusion till their marriage, and, so to speak, regularly under lock
and key,” which had the “effect of rendering the girls excessively
bashful, and even prudish,” and so stupid, in all probability, that
no wonder the men considered marriage a punishment, and sought
entertainment with the educated Hetæræ—as to-day in France.
Even young married women were obliged to have a chaperon.
“No respectable lady thought of going out without a female
slave.” “Even the married woman shrank back and blushed if
she chanced to be seen at the window by a man.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>PLATO ON COURTSHIP</h3>

<p class='c013'>It is one of the most remarkable facts in the history of Love
and of social philosophy that Plato, the most modern of all ancient
thinkers, <em>foresaw the importance of pre-matrimonial acquaintance</em>
as the basis of a rational and happy marriage choice long before
any other writer. Making allowance for the fact that Greek
notions as to what is within “the rules of modesty” differed from
our own, the following passage cannot be too deeply pondered:
“People,” Plato tells us in the sixth book of the <cite>Laws</cite> (p. 771),
“must be acquainted with those into whose families and to whom
they marry and are given in marriage; in such matters as far as
possible to avoid mistakes is all-important, and with this serious
purpose let games be instituted, in which youths and maidens
shall dance together, seeing and being seen naked, at a proper age
and on a suitable occasion, not transgressing the rules of modesty.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>PARENTAL <i>VERSUS</i> LOVERS’ CHOICE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Marriages in Greece were often arranged for girls while they
were mere children, of course without any reference to their
choice, since they were looked upon as the <em>property</em> of the father,
who could dispose of them at his pleasure. Besides these early
betrothals there was an obstacle to free choice in the Athenian
law which forbade a citizen under very severe penalties to marry
a foreigner. And again, “In the case of a father dying intestate,
and without male children, his heiress had no choice in marriage;
she was compelled by law to marry her nearest kinsman, not in
the ascending line.... Where there were several co-heiresses,
they were respectively married to their kinsmen, the nearest having
the first choice”—a law resembling one in the Jewish code,
and exemplified by Ruth, as pointed out in Smith’s <cite>Dictionary</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>How Sexual Selection was rendered impracticable in Greece
is further shown in the following citations from Becker: “The
choice of the bride seldom depended on previous, or at least on
intimate acquaintance. More attention was generally paid to the
position of a damsel’s family, and the amount of her dowry, than
to her <em>personal qualities</em>.” "It was usual for a father to choose
for his son a wife, and one perhaps whom the bridegroom had
never seen." “Widows frequently married again; this was often
in compliance with the testamentary dispositions of their husbands,
as little regard being paid to their wishes as in the case of girls.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus we see that three causes combined to prevent the growth
of Romantic Love in Greece—the degraded position of women, the
absence of direct Courtship, and the impossibility of exercising
Individual Preference.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>THE HETÆRÆ</h3>

<p class='c013'>That the absolute seclusion and chaperonage of the young
women, and their consequent ignorance and insipidity, were the
reasons why they could neither feel nor inspire Romantic Love, is
shown by the fact that there existed in Greece in the time of
Perikles a mentally superior class of women who appear to have
aroused Love, or something very like it, by means of the artistic
and intellectual charms which they united with their physical
beauty. These women were called Ἡταίραι, or <em>companions</em>, evidently
to distinguish them from the domestic women who were no
“companions” after the first charm of novelty had worn away:
a state of affairs for which of course the men themselves, who
gave them no education and locked them up, were to blame.</p>

<p class='c001'>What seems paradoxical is that these women, who were morally
inferior to the others, should have been the first to inspire in men
a more <em>refined</em> sort of Love; but the paradox is rendered the
more probable by the circumstance that in India, likewise, we
found the first traces of Romantic Love among the Bayaderes, a
class corresponding to the Hetæræ.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is reason to believe that Aspasia, who aided the greatest
statesman of antiquity in writing his stirring speeches, inspired
not only him but other great contemporaries with true Romantic
passion—which they were enabled to feel because men of genius
are not only intellectually but also emotionally ahead of their
time.</p>

<p class='c001'>Diotima was another of these women. She was also revered
as a prophetess, and is credited by Plato with having given
Sokrates, and through him Greece, the first adequate discourse on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Love—a discourse, we may add, in which some flashes of true
modern insight are mingled with the curiously confused notions of
the Greeks on the subject of Love and Friendship. What these
notions were is best seen by briefly considering the peculiarities of</p>

<h3 class='c014'>PLATONIC LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>On this subject the most incorrect and absurd notions universally
pervade modern literature and conversation. As commonly
understood, “Platonic Love” means a friendship between a man
and a woman from which all traces of passion are excluded. Such a
notion is utterly foreign to Plato’s way of thinking, and is nowhere
referred to in his writings. Platonic love has nothing to do with
women whatever. It is an attachment between a man and a youth,
which may be defined as friendship united with the ecstatic ardour
which in modern life is associated only with Romantic Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. George Grote thus describes what he calls the “truly
Platonic conception of love”. It is “a vehement impulse towards
mental communion with some favoured youth, in view of producing
mental improvement, good, and happiness to both persons concerned:
the same impulse afterwards expanding, so as to grasp
the good and beautiful in a larger sense, and ultimately to fasten
on goodness and beauty in the pure Ideal.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Once more, Platonic love might be defined as <em>creative friendship</em>,
which has for its object the conception of great ideas,—of
works of art, literature, philosophy. Such a friendship, Plato tells
us, should be formed between a man and a youth, not too young,
but when his beard begins to grow and his intellect to develop;
and such a friendship is apt to last throughout life.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps the most striking instance in Greek literature of
Platonic love is that given in Plato’s <cite>Symposium</cite> as existing
between the pure-minded Sokrates, who kept aloof from all Greek
vices, and the beautiful young Alkibiades. This youth thus
describes the effect which the discourse of Sokrates has on him:
“When I hear him, my heart leaps in my breast, more than it
does among the Korybantes, and tears roll down my cheeks at his
words, and I notice that many others have the same experience.
When I heard Perikles and other excellent orators, I came to the
conclusion that they spoke well; but this experience was different
from the other, and my soul did not lose its control or gnash its
teeth like a prostrate slave, but by this Marsyas (= Sokrates) I
was put into such a mood that the condition in which I found
myself did not seem praiseworthy.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>He further describes Sokrates as being always “in love with
beautiful youths, and talking with them, and being quite beside
himself”; hence when he (Alkibiades) appears at the Symposium,
and finds Sokrates sitting next to the most beautiful man in the
company, he chides him in words which have exactly the sound of
Jealousy inspired by <em>Romantic</em> Love: “And why did you recline
here and not next to Aristophanes, or some other wit, or would-be
wit, but, instead, crowded forward in order to be next to the
handsomest?”</p>

<p class='c001'>To which Sokrates replies: “Agathon, come to my assistance;
for my love for this person has cost me dearly. Ever since I
have loved him, I have not been allowed to look at anybody, or
to talk with any one who is beautiful, or else this youth, in his
jealousy and envy, does unheard-of-things, and chides me, and
hardly refrains from violence. Be on your guard, therefore, that
he may not resort to violence now, and reconcile us, or if he dares
to become unruly, assist me; for I very much fear his madness
and infatuation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Although this was probably said in the playful tone common
to Sokrates, it yet is noticeable how closely the language used
resembles the language of modern Romantic Love.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>SAPPHO AND FEMALE FRIENDSHIP</h3>

<p class='c011'>To this form of Platonic or mono-sexual love there existed a
female counterpart, as shown in some of the lyric effusions of
Greek poets. Some of these poets, it is true, especially Anakreon,
knew naught of the imaginative side of Love—of its protracted
tortures and intermittent joys. Like a butterfly that kisses every
flower on its way, he “cared only for the enjoyment of the passing
moment.” But Sappho apparently wrote of Love in terms worthy
of Heine or Byron, as shown even in this crude translation of one
of her poems:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“While gazing on thy charms I hung,</div>
      <div class='line'>My voice died faltering on my tongue,</div>
      <div class='line'>With subtle flames my bosom glows,</div>
      <div class='line'>Quick through each vein the poison flows;</div>
      <div class='line'>Dark dimming mists my eyes surround,</div>
      <div class='line'>My ears with hollow murmurs sound.</div>
      <div class='line'>My limbs with dewy chillness freeze,</div>
      <div class='line'>On my whole frame pale tremblings seize,</div>
      <div class='line'>And losing colour, sense, and breath,</div>
      <div class='line'>I seem quite languishing in death.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Longinus calls this the most perfect expression in all ancient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>literature of the effects of Love. It happens, however, to have
nothing to do with Love. For, as Plato’s “love” is merely
ecstatic friendship between man and youth, so Sappho’s love is
friendship between two women. This is the opinion of Bode and
Müller, and it is entirely borne out by the language of the original
text.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been suggested that Sappho, being a woman, and a
Greek woman, could not have addressed such glowing words to a
man without violating the current notions of decorum; and hence
wrote as if she were a man addressing a woman. But Sappho was
one of the Æolian women who had greater liberty than the
Athenians; and she was, moreover, a blue-stocking who would not
have stuck at such a trifle as shocking Greek notions regarding
woman’s privileges. And in some of her poems she <em>does</em> mention
a youth “to whom she gave her whole heart, while he requited
her passion with cold indifference” (Müller).</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the Platonists, Maximus Tyrius (<i>dis.</i> 24, p. 297), takes
the same view regarding Sappho. “The love of the Lesbian
poet,” he says, “what can it be, if we may compare remote with
more recent things than the Sokratic art of love? For both
appear to promote the same <em>Friendship</em>, she among women, he
among men. They both confess they love many, and are captivated
by all beauties. For what Alkibiades and Charmides are to
Sokrates, Gyrinna and Atthis and Anaktoria are to Sappho.”
“Even Sokrates confesses that it was from Sappho that he partly
derived his noble views of the enthusiastic <em>love of mental beauty</em>”
(<cite>Phædon</cite>, c. 225).</p>

<p class='c001'>To one of the girls just referred to, Sappho addresses these
words: “Again does the strength-dissolving Eros, that bittersweet,
resistless monster, agitate me; but to thee, O Atthis, the
thought of me is importunate; thou fliest to Andromeda.” “It
is obvious,” says Müller, “that this attachment bears less the
character of maternal interest than of passionate love; as amongst
Dorians in Sparta and Crete analogous connections between men
and youths, in which the latter were trained to noble and manly
deeds, were carried on in a language of high-wrought and passionate
feeling, which had all the character of an attachment between
persons of different sexes. This mixture of feelings, which among
nations of a calmer temperament have always been perfectly
distinct, is an essential feature of the Greek character.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Greek Love, <i>i.e.</i> Friendship, being thus tinged and strengthened,
as we see in the cases of Sokrates and Alkibiades, Sappho and
Atthis, by jealousy, ecstatic adoration, exclusiveness, admiration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>of personal beauty, and other qualities which modern civilisation
has transferred to Romantic Love, we are enabled to understand
why Friendship was so much more potent and prevalent in
antiquity than it is now, when, having lost these traits <em>through
the differentiation of emotions</em>, it seems “insipid to those who
have tasted Love.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The lesson to be learned from this whole discussion on Greek
Friendship is of extreme importance to the psychology of Love.
It is this: The Greeks were too intellectual and refined not to
have at least a vague presentiment of the higher possibilities and
charms of imaginative Love. But Greek women—with the rare
exceptions referred to—were too stupid to enable the men to
realise their vague ideal. Hence they sought it in ardent attachments
to youths, who <em>were</em> quick-minded and able to <em>sympathise</em>
with their intellectual aspirations. And thus Greek Love became
identical with male friendship—the female friendship referred to
being a sort of compensating echo.</p>

<p class='c001'>Greek Love is symbolised in the mythic youth Narcissus, who
scorns all the beautiful nymphs that are eager for his caresses, and
falls in love with his own image reflected in the water.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>GREEK BEAUTY</h3>

<p class='c013'>It even seems as if, apart from Love, the Greeks admired
youthful masculine beauty more than feminine charms; and many
of them would probably have agreed with Schopenhauer that men
are more beautiful than women. Certain it is that, as the most
eminent critic of Greek art, Winckelmann, points out “the
supreme beauty of Greek art is male rather than female.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The following citation from Grote’s famous work on Plato
suggests some reasons for this fact, besides reflecting further light
on points discussed in the preceding pages:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“In the Hellenic point of view, upon which Plato builds, the
attachment of man to woman was regarded as a natural impulse
and as a domestic, social sentiment; yet as belonging to <em>a commonplace
rather than to an exalted mind</em>, and seldom or never rising
to that pitch of enthusiasm which overpowers all other emotions,
absorbs the whole man, and aims either at the joint performance
of great exploits, or the joint prosecution of intellectual improvement
by continued colloquy. We must remember that the wives
and daughters of citizens were seldom seen abroad; that she had
learned nothing except spinning and weaving; that the fact of her
having seen so little and heard as little as possible, was considered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>as rendering her more acceptable to her husband; that her sphere
of duty and exertion was confined to the interior of the family.
The beauty of women yielded satisfaction to the senses, but little
beyond. It was the masculine beauty of youth that fired the
Hellenic imagination with glowing and impassioned sentiment.
The finest youths, and those, too, of the best families and education,
were seen habitually uncovered in the Palæstra and at the public
festival-matches; engaged in active contention and graceful exercise,
under the direction of professional trainers. The sight of the
living form in such perfection, movement, and variety, awakened a
powerful emotional sympathy, blended with æsthetic sentiment,
which in the more susceptible natures was exalted into intense and
passionate devotion. The terms in which this feeling is described,
both by Plato and Xenophon, are among the strongest which the
language affords—and are predicated even of Sokrates himself.
Far from being ashamed of this feeling, they consider it admirable
and beneficial, though very liable to abuse, which they emphatically
denounce and forbid. In their view it was an idealising passion,
which tended to raise a man above the vulgar and selfish pursuits
of life, and even above the fear of death. The devoted attachments
which it inspired were dreaded by the despots, who forbade the
assemblage of youths for exercise in the Palæstra.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Another reason for the Greek preference of masculine beauty is
suggested by Mr. Lecky, who attributes it to the fact that the
principal art of the Greeks, sculpture, is “especially suited to
represent male beauty, or the beauty of strength”; whereas
“female beauty, or the beauty of softness,” became the principal
object of the painters, after Christianity had won attention for the
feminine virtues of gentleness and delicacy. (For further remarks
on Greek Beauty, see the chapters on “Four Sources of Beauty,”
and “The Nose.”)</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CUPID’S ARROWS</h3>

<p class='c013'>Possibly some of my readers have not yet quieted all their doubts
regarding the existence of real Love among the Greeks; for did
they not have special deities of love—Aphrodite and Eros, Venus
and Cupid? Quite so; but those familiar with Greek history
know that the cult of Venus had but a remote connection with
imaginative or Romantic Love, which alone is here under consideration.
Yet our modern poets owe a vast debt of gratitude to the
ancient bards for these mythic deities, whom they have simply
taken and idealised, like Love itself. There is, especially, the
mischievous Dan Cupid, who, in his modern metamorphosis, is still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“the anointed sovereign of sighs and groans.” This little fellow
seems to have been taken very seriously indeed by the earliest
Greeks. He has one attribute—wings—which we readily understand,
as Love is inconstant ever; but another of his attributes
would excite the greatest surprise in our minds were we not so
accustomed to it as to accept it as a matter of course, namely, his
arrows. It would seem more in accordance with modern notions
that he should produce his magic effects by means of Love-potions
or other Love-charms, rather than with such a warlike weapon as
an arrow.</p>

<p class='c001'>A German feuilletonist, Dr. Michael Haberlandt, has lately
advanced an ingenious theory to account for this weapon. The
ancient Greeks had the peculiar belief that all diseases were caused
by the invisible poisoned arrows of evil or angry deities; as in the
well-known case of the offended Apollo sending his pest-laden
arrows among the Hellenes. Now love, in the irresistible and
maddening, though primitive form known to the early Greeks, was
doubtless looked on as a real, mysterious affliction, and not merely
as love sickness in the figurative modern sense: what more natural
therefore than to attribute it to the arrows of a mischievous deity?</p>

<p class='c001'>In course of time poetic fancy added to the image of Cupid
other attributes that naturally suggested themselves: the wings to
symbolise fickleness; a bandage to indicate blindness; while the
arrows were represented as dipped in poison, gall, or honey. The
curious fact may be added that the ancient East Indians, whose
deities numbered 330,000,000 (in round numbers), likewise had a
god of love armed with bow and arrows: a conception which they
seem to have originated independently of the Greeks.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>ORIGIN OF LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Plato’s <cite>Symposium</cite> contains two curious theories of the cause
and origin of love, which, in conclusion, may be briefly summarised,
as they help to characterise Greek notions on this subject. The
first is placed in the mouth of Sokrates, who says he heard it of
the Hetaira Diotima. What, she asks, is the cause of this love-sickness,
this anxiety of men and animals, first to get a mate, and
then to take care of the offspring? It is, she replies, the desire to
perpetuate themselves. For just as the famous heroes and
heroines—Alkestis, Achilles, Kadros—would not have so nobly
sacrificed their lives had they not been sustained by the thought
that their fame and glory would survive among future generations;
so the fact that parents in the affection for their young will even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>go so far as to sacrifice their own lives to protect them, is due to
their craving for immortality in their offspring.</p>

<p class='c001'>This theory may be regarded as a vague foreshadowing of
Schopenhauer’s, which will be considered in another place.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second theory of the origin of love is attributed by Plato to
Aristophanes, who relates it in the form of a myth. Human
nature, he begins, was not always as it is now. At the beginning
there were three sexes: one, the male, descended of the sun-god;
the second, female, descended of the earth; and the third, which
united the attributes of both sexes, descended of the moon. Each
of these beings, moreover, had two pairs of hands and legs, and
two faces, and the figure was round, and in rapid motion revolved
like a wheel, the pairs of legs alternately touching the ground and
describing an arc in the air.</p>

<p class='c001'>These beings were fierce, powerful, and vain, so they attempted
to storm heaven and attack the gods. As Zeus did not wish to
destroy them—since that would have deprived him of sacrifices
and other forms of human devotion—he resolved to punish them
by diminishing their strength. So he directed Apollo to cut each
of them into two, which was done; and thus the number of human
beings was doubled. Each of these half-beings now continually
wandered about, seeking its other half. And when they found
each other, their only desire was to be reunited by Vulcan and
never be parted again. “And this longing and striving after
union—this is what is meant by the name of Love.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The waggish Aristophanes appends a caution to human beings
not to offend Zeus again, because it was that god’s intention, on a
repetition of the offence, to split human beings once more, so that
they would have to hop about on one leg!</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the metaphors used by the comic poet is very pretty,
even if translated into terms of Modern Love. He compares the
two divided halves of one human being to the dice which among
the ancients were used as marks of hospitality, being broken into
two pieces, of which each person received one, and which were
afterwards fitted together in token of recognition. A pair of
lovers, then, are like these halved dice, naturally belonging to
each other, and craving to be reunited.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>ROMAN LOVE</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>WOMAN’S POSITION</h3>

<p class='c013'>Among the Romans the domestic position of women was on the
whole much more favourable to the growth of feminine culture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>than in Greece. They were not jealously guarded in special apartments,
but were allowed to retain their seat at the table and join
in the conversation when guests arrived, as Cornelius Nepos points
out with a pardonable sense of superiority. Becker, in his <cite>Gallus</cite>,
thus states the difference between Greek and Roman treatment of
women: “Whilst we see that in most of the Grecian states, and
especially in Athens, the women (<i>i.e.</i> the whole female sex) were
little esteemed and treated as children all their lives, confined to
the gynaikoreitis, shut out from social life and all intercourse with
men and their amusements, we find that in Rome exactly the
reverse was the case. Although the wife is naturally subordinate
to the husband, yet she is always treated with open attention and
regard. The Roman housewife always appears as the mistress of
the whole household economy, instructress of the children, and
guardian of the honour of the house, equally esteemed with the
paterfamilias both in and out of the house.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Walking abroad was only limited by scruple and custom, not
by a law or the jealous will of the husband. The women frequented
public theatres as well as the men, and took their places
with them at festive banquets.” "Even the vestals participated
in the banquets of the men." Although “learned women were
dreaded,” a knowledge of Greek and the fine arts was in later
times counted an essential part of feminine culture. “Certain
advantages accrued to those who had many children, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>jus trium
liberorum</i></span>.” Masculine “voluntary celibacy was considered, in
very early times, as censurable and even guilty;” and from
Festus “we learn that there was a celibate fine.” The statement
apparently credited by Mr. Lecky that for 520 years there was no
case of divorce in Rome, has been shown to rest on a misconception
of a passage in Gellius. Yet “manners were so severe, that
a senator was censured for indecency because he had kissed his
wife in the presence of their daughter.” It was also considered
“in a high degree disgraceful for a Roman mother to delegate to
a nurse the duty of suckling her child.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>NO WOOING AND CHOICE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Yet amid all these domestic virtues and family affections we
search in vain for the prevalence of Romantic Love. We have
already seen that for the growth of this sentiment something more
is needed than domestic affection, and that something is comprised
in the word <span class='sc'>Wooing</span>. There was no wooing at Rome. In most
cases, the father took his daughter’s heart in his hand, and, treating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>it as a piece of personal property, bestowed it on the suitor
who best “suited” him. “From the earliest times,” says Ploss,
“it was customary in Rome to marry girls when they had barely
reached their twelfth or thirteenth year; engagements were probably
made at a still earlier age. Although legally the daughter’s
consent was required, in actual practice <em>she exercised no choice</em>; her
extreme youth in itself preventing this. Often a marriage contract
was a mere matter of agreement between two families in
which love and personal favour were disregarded; nor did even the
betrothal bring the future couple into closer intimacy.” With
reference to the laws of the Twelve Tablets, M. Legouvé remarks,
in his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Histoire Morale des Femmes</cite></span>, that “Rome was worthy of
Athens. Not only did a Roman father dispose of his daughter
against her inclination, but he even had the right to dissolve a
marriage into which she had entered, and to take away from his
daughter the husband he had given her, whom she loved, and by
whom she had children.” In justice, however, it must be added
that this latter right was rarely exercised; but the fact that the
Romans could tolerate the very notion of such a law shows what
little account was made of love.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another absurd impediment to personal choice was raised by
the Theodosian Code, which compelled a girl to marry a man who
had the same calling as her father—a custom which, indeed, seems
to prevail in parts of Europe to the present day, and which is as
incompatible with Love as the ancient Hebrew rule that the oldest
daughter must be married first—a rule which compelled Jacob to
marry Leah before he could get his beloved Rachel, for whom he
had laboured seven years. “First come first served” is a rule
which Cupid rarely heeds in the case of several sisters.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the case of the men it is possible that Sexual Selection
occasionally came into play, when early betrothals did not prevent
it; for the old Romans were too rational to anticipate the silly
and criminal French custom of bargaining for a bride before they
had even seen her. In such a case, if the bride was attractive, the
suitor’s imagination, dwelling on the fact that this vision of loveliness
was to be his own, exclusively, for ever, may have been
warmed for a moment with something very like romantic sentiment.
But beauty in Rome, Ovid informs us, was very rare—"How
few are able to boast it!"—so that even with the men who
had a choice, Individual Preference based on Personal Beauty
could have been rarely exercised. And as for the women who had
no choice, they may have felt a temporary elation on first meeting
their destined husbands; but this feeling was merely the manifestation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>of a vague instinct, comparable to the “love” which a bevy
of modern boarding-school “buds” show for the only man they are
allowed to see regularly,—their ugly teacher,—and the unreality
and silliness of which they laugh at themselves when they are at
last allowed to meet the man of their own, individual, free choice,
who teaches them the feeling of real Romantic Love.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VIRGIL, DRYDEN, AND SCOTT</h3>

<p class='c013'>Nevertheless, compared with Greek literature, the works of the
Roman poets show an advance in their conception of Love; for
they avoid at least the Hellenic confusion of love with friendship.
Compared with the best modern poets, however, who labour with
the pure gold of Love alone, the Roman poet’s productions still
show much of the base ore from which the modern gold has been
extracted. It is interesting, in this connection, to read what
Dryden has to say concerning Virgil’s conception of Love, and
Scott’s comments on Dryden.</p>

<p class='c001'>In his dedication of the <cite>Æneid</cite>, Dryden speaks of Book IV. as
"This noble episode, wherein the whole passion of love is more
exactly described than in any other poet. Love was the theme
of his fourth book; and though it is the shortest of the whole
Æneis, yet there he has given its beginning, its progress, its traverses,
and its conclusion; and had exhausted so entirely his
subject, that he could resume it but very slightly in the eight
ensuing books.</p>

<p class='c001'>“She was warmed with the graceful appearance of the hero;
she smothered those sparkles out of decency; but conversation
blew them up into a flame. Then she was forced to make a confidante
of her whom she might best trust, her own sister, who
approves the passion, and thereby augments it: then succeeds her
public owning it; and after that the consummation. Of Venus
and Juno, Jupiter and Mercury, I say nothing; for they were all
machining work; but, possession having cooled his love, as it
increased hers, she soon perceived the change, or at least grew
suspicious of a change; this suspicion soon turned to jealousy, and
jealousy to rage; then she disdains and threatens, and again is
humble and entreats, and nothing availing, despairs, curses, and at
last becomes her own executioner. See here the whole process of
that passion, to which nothing can be added.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Sir Walter Scott, however, does add, in a foot-note to his
edition of Dryden: “I am afraid this passage, given as a just
description of love, serves to confirm what is elsewhere stated, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Dryden’s ideas of the female sex and of the passion were very gross
and malicious.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>OVID’S ART OF MAKING LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Gross and malicious also are the ideas of the female sex and the
passion frequently encountered in the poems of Ovid; not so coarse
and cynical, indeed, as in Martial and Catullus, but sufficiently so
to have confounded the æsthetic judgment of the present generation,
and spread the notion that Virgil and Horace are greater
poets than Ovid, whereas, from the point of view of originality and
imaginativeness, by far the greatest of the three is Ovid, who also
had much more influence on the great writers of the best period of
English literature than his rivals, as Professor W. Y. Sellar has
pointed out.</p>

<p class='c001'>Both these circumstances are to be regretted—the undervaluation
of Ovid’s genius as well as his frequent frivolity on which it
is based. For Ovid was unquestionably the first poet who had
a conception of the higher possibilities of Love; in fact he was
the greatest, and the only great, Love-poet before Dante. His
rare genius enabled him to anticipate and depict the modern imaginative
side of Love, even while he seemed wholly devoted to the
ancient sensual side. And, in reading his poems, great caution is
necessary, lest these <em>emotional anticipations</em> of his quasi-modern
genius be supposed to have been common and prevalent among
less gifted Romans of his time.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ovid was a profound observer and psychologist, and had a
most subtle knowledge of contemporary feminine nature; Although
the principal object of his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ars Amoris</cite></span> is to teach men how to
out-trump the natural cunning of women, yet he does not forget
his feminine readers, but gives them numerous hints regarding
the best way of fascinating fickle men. In the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Remedia Amoris</cite></span>
he describes various remedies for healing Cupid’s wounds, most of
which are approved to the present day; and the <cite>Elegies</cite> and
<cite>Heroides</cite>, too, are full of pretty modern touches and flashes of
insight. A few of these points may be briefly alluded to.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coyness, although often manifested by the Roman women in
almost as crude a manner as among savages, does not appear to
have been appreciated by all of them at its full value; so the poet
frequently counsels them as to the more subtle ways of exercising
it; one of his rules for women being, that if they have offended
an admirer, the best way to make him forget it is to pretend to
be offended themselves, which will restore the equilibrium. How
the consciousness of being beautiful makes a woman courageous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>coy, and cruel is shown in another place. That eyes have a
language plainer than speech is not a modern discovery; and that
a short absence favours, long absence kills, passion was also known
to Ovid. He warns men against the danger of feigning love,
because this may end in arousing genuine passion. Men are
informed that courage and confidence in one’s ability to win a
woman are half the battle. And disappointed lovers are assured
that failure sometimes turns into an advantage, for it may arouse
pity, and love enter in the guise of friendship.</p>

<p class='c001'>The emotional hyperbole and mixed feelings of Love are not
strangers to Ovid. He compares the tortures of Love to the
berries on the trees in number, to the shells on the sea-beach; for
true Love, he says, always creates anguish and pain; and “the
sweetest torment on earth is woman.” Among the companions of
Cupid are “flattery and illusion.” But “even if the beloved
deceives me with false words, hope itself will yield me great
enjoyment,” could only have been written by one who realised
the imaginative side of love. And in another passage the poet
directly enjoins the necessity of intellectual culture to take the
place of the faded charms of youth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hero’s Letter to Leander in the <cite>Heroides</cite> contains some pretty
touches. Leander has informed his love that when the storm
prevents him from swimming over to her, his mind yet hastens to
meet her. But Hero is in great trouble at his prolonged absence,
and her deepest anguish is Jealousy of a possible rival: in the
absence of real grounds of apprehension, her imagination invents
them, as in a modern lover’s mind. She suspects that his passion
has lost the ardour which sustained him in his difficult feat; and,
too weak to quite swim over to him and back again, and anxious
to save him the double journey, she suggests that they should
meet in the middle of the sea, exchange a kiss, and each return to
the shore whence they came.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is there anything more exquisitely romantic or pathetic in all
modern Love-poetry—in Shakspere, Heine, Burns, or Byron?</p>

<h3 class='c014'>BIRTH OF GALLANTRY</h3>

<p class='c013'>Becker says of the Greeks that “The men were very careful as
to their behaviour in the presence of women, but they were <em>quite
strangers to those minute attentions which constitute the gallantry
of the moderns</em>.” This holds true apparently of all other nations of
antiquity; and to a student of the history of Love it is therefore
of exceeding interest to find in Ovid’s poetry the first evidences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>of the existence of Gallantry—a disposition on the part of the men
to sacrifice their own comfort to the pleasures and whims of women.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. G. A. Simcox was the first writer, so far as I know, who
pointed out Ovid’s priority in this matter (in his <cite>History of Latin
Literature</cite>). In Ovid, he says, “The whole description of gallantry
implies that the idea was a novelty, and that the lover would
require a great deal of encouragement to enable him to make the
sacrifice of paying such attentions as could be commanded from a
servant. This throws a new light on the habit the Augustan
poets have of calling their mistress <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>domina</i></span>, which is more noteworthy,
for they call no man <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dominus</i></span>. One does not trace the
idea at all in Latin comedy, where the heroines are for the most
part <em>only too thankful to be caressed and protected</em>. One finds the
word in Lucilius, but even in Catullus it is hardly established.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Instances of gallant behaviour are not rare in Ovid’s poetry;
but the didactic tone in which they are detailed makes it almost
appear as if the poet were recommending to his countrymen the
value of a nice little discovery of his own which would convert
crude love-making into a fine art. Never be so ungallant—he
says in effect, though he does not use the word—as to refer to a
woman’s faults or shortcomings. Compliment her, on the contrary,
on her good points—her face, her hair, her tapering fingers,
her pretty foot. At the circus applaud whatever she applauds.
Adjust her cushion, put the footstool where it ought to be, and
keep her comfortable by fanning her. And at dinner, when she
has tasted the wine, quickly seize the cup and put your lips to the
place where she has sipped.</p>

<p class='c001'>Unfortunately this morning dawn of Romantic Love, as depicted
in the pages of Ovid, was soon hidden beneath the dark
clouds of mediæval barbarism, not to emerge again till a thousand
years later.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>MEDIÆVAL LOVE</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>CELIBACY <i>VERSUS</i> MARRIAGE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Were I asked to name the four most refining influences in
modern civilisation I would answer: Women, Beauty, Love, and
Marriage. Were I asked to name the essence of the early
mediæval spirit I would say: Deadly Enmity toward Women,
Beauty, Love, and Marriage.</p>

<p class='c001'>This pathologic attitude of the mediæval mind was at first a
natural reaction against the incredible depravity and licentiousness
that prevailed under the Roman Empire. But the reaction went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>to such preposterous extremes that the resulting state of affairs
was even more degrading and deplorable than the original evil.
It was like inoculating a man with leprosy to cure him of smallpox.
It was bad enough to treat marriage as a <em>farce</em>, as did the
later Romans, among whom there were women who had their
eighth and tenth husband, while one case is related of a woman
“who was married to her twenty-third husband, she herself being
his twenty-first wife”; while the public looked upon this case as
a “match” in a double sense, the survivor being publicly crowned
and feted as champion. But a thousand times worse was the
mediæval notion that marriage is a <em>crime</em>. And this preposterous
notion—that a relation on which all civilisation is based, which is
sanctioned even by many animals and ignored by only the very
lowest of the savages—this criminal notion was foisted on the
world by the fanatical priesthood in whose hands unfortunately
Christianity was placed for centuries, to be distorted, vitiated, and
utilised for political, criminal, and selfish purposes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The services rendered,” says Mr. Lecky, “by the ascetics in
imprinting on the minds of men a profound and enduring conviction
of the importance of chastity, though extremely great, were
seriously counterbalanced by their noxious influence upon marriage.
Two or three beautiful descriptions of this institution have been
culled out of the immense mass of patristic writings; but in
general it would be difficult to conceive anything more coarse and
more repulsive than the manner in which they regarded it....
The tender love which it elicits, the holy and beautiful domestic
qualities that follow in its train, were almost absolutely omitted
from consideration. The object of the ascetic was to attract men
to a life of virginity, and, as a necessary consequence, marriage
was treated as an inferior state.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The days of Chivalry were not yet,” we read in Smith’s
<cite>Dictionary of Christian Antiquities</cite>, “and we cannot but notice
even in the greatest of the Christian fathers a lamentably low estimate
of woman, and, consequently, of the marriage relationship.”</p>

<p class='c001'>What an inexhaustible source of mediæval immorality this
contemptuous treatment of marriage by the most influential class
of society proved, has been so often depicted in glaring colours
that these pages need not be tainted with illustrations.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>WOMAN’S LOWEST DEGRADATION</h3>

<p class='c013'>Woman was represented by the Fathers “as the door of hell,
as the mother of all human ills. She should be ashamed at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>very thought that she is a woman; she should live in continual
penance on account of the curses she has brought upon the world.
Women were even forbidden by a provincial council in the
sixth century, on account of their impurity, to receive the
Eucharist into their naked hands. Their essentially subordinate
position was continually maintained” (Lecky).</p>

<p class='c001'>Not even the Koran took such a degrading view of woman as
these early “Christian Fathers.” For the current notion that the
existence of a soul in woman is denied by the Mahometan faith is
contradicted by several passages in the Koran.</p>

<p class='c001'>The lowest depths of feminine degradation and the sublimest
heights of fanatical folly and crime, however, were not reached in
this early period, but some centuries later, when the incredible
brutalities of the witchcraft trials began. The vast majority of
the victims were women; and Professor Scherr, in his <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Geschichte
der Deutschen Frauenwelt</cite></span>, estimates that <em>in Germany alone</em> at
least one hundred thousand “witches” were burnt at the stake.
No one on reading the accounts of these trials can help feeling
that Shakspere made a mistake when he wrote that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“All the world’s a stage,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all the men and women merely players.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>He should have said,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“All the world’s a madhouse,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all the men are fools and demons.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>More demons than fools, however. Superstition was, indeed,
epidemic during the Middle Ages; but those who superintended
the witches’ trials—the rulers and the clergy—were not the
persons affected by it. If they did execute 100,000 victims in
Germany; if they did murder girls of twelve, ten, eight, and even
seven years, on the accusation of having borne children whose
father was Satan, or of having murdered persons who in some
cases were actually present at the trial—the reason of this was
not because the authorities believed this cruel nonsense. The real
reason is given by Scherr: “The circumstance that the property
of those who were burnt at the stake was confiscated, two-thirds
of it getting into the hands of the landowner (Grundherr), the
other third into those of the <em>judges, clergy, accusers, and executioners</em>,
has beyond doubt kindled countless witch-fires.... During
the Thirty Years’ War, especially, the trials for witchcraft became
a greedily-utilised source of profit to many a country nobleman in
reduced circumstances, and no less to bishops, abbots, and
councillors, who were in financial straits. Indeed, as early as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>sixteenth century, one of the opponents of witches’ trials, Cornelius
Loos, justly observed that the whole proceeding was simply ‘a
newly-invented alchemy for converting human blood into gold.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>What difference is there between these civilised savages and
the Australian who eats his wife when he gets tired of her? Let
those who are fond of seeking needles in haystacks search for
traces of Romantic Love under such circumstances.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>NEGATION OF FEMININE CHOICE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Feudal legislation combined with clerical contempt and criminal
persecution in lowering woman’s position. There were numerous
and stringent enactments which “rendered it impossible for
women to succeed to any considerable amount of property, and
which almost reduced them to the alternative of marriage or a
nunnery. The complete inferiority of the sex was continually
maintained by the law; and that generous public opinion which
in Rome had frequently revolted against the injustice done to
girls, in depriving them of the greater part of the inheritance of
their fathers, totally disappeared.” Beaumanoir says that “Every
husband may beat his wife if she refuses to obey his orders, or if
she speaks ill of him or tells an untruth, provided he does so with
moderation.” Early German law permitted the father, and
subsequently the husband, to sell, punish, or even kill the wife;
and in England wife-beating has not yet died out.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If, in the times of St. Louis,” says Legouvé, “a young vassal
of some royal fief was sought in marriage, it was necessary for her
father to get his seigneur’s permission for her marriage; the
seigneur asked the king’s consent to his permission, and not till
after all these agreements (father, seigneur, king) was <em>she</em> consulted
regarding this contract which affected her whole life.” How
beautifully such a law must have fostered the sentiment of Love
which depends on Individual Preference and Special Sympathy!</p>

<p class='c001'>Such laws no doubt were simply echoes of clerical teachings.
“The girl,” says St. Ambrose of Rebecca, whom he holds up
herein as an example, “is not consulted about her espousals, for
she awaits the judgment of her parents; inasmuch as a girl’s
modesty will not allow her to choose a husband” (!). Irish
“bulls” appear to have crept even into ecclesiastic enactments,
for we read in Smith’s <cite>Dictionary of Christian Antiquities</cite> that
“An Irish council in the time of St. Patrick, about the year 450
lays it down that the will of the girl is to be inquired of the
father, and that the girl is to do what her father chooses, inasmuch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>as man is the head of the woman.” “Even widows,” we
read further, “under the age of twenty-five were forbidden by a
law of Valentinian and Gratian to marry without their parents’
consent; and St. Ambrose desires young widows to leave the
choice of their second husbands to their parents.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Compayré states in his <cite>History of Pedagogy</cite> that in the
seventeenth century “woman was still regarded as the inferior of
man, in the lower classes as a drudge, in the higher as an ornament.
In her case intellectual culture was regarded as either
useless or dangerous; and the education that was given her was
to fit her for a life of devotion or a life of seclusion from society.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Still more, of course, was this the case in the times of St.
Jerome, who in his letter to Læta on the education of her
daughter Paula, tells her that the girl must never eat in public,
or eat meat. “Never let Paula listen to musical instruments.”
Even her affections must be suppressed—all except the devotional
sentiments. She must not be “in the gatherings and in the
company of her kindred; let her be found only in retirement.”
“Do not allow Paula to feel more affection for one of her
companions than for others.” And this ascetic moralist even
recommends uncleanliness as a virtue: “I entirely forbid a young
girl to bathe;” which may be matched with the following, also
cited from Compayré: “The first preceptors of Gargantua said
that it sufficed to comb one’s hair with the four fingers and the
thumb; and that whoever combed, washed, and cleansed himself
otherwise was losing his time in this world.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In such a rough atmosphere of masculine ignorance, fanaticism,
and cruelty the feminine virtues of sympathy, tenderness, grace,
and sweetness could not have flourished very luxuriantly. Consequently
there is doubtless more than a grain of truth in mediæval
proverbs about women, cynical and brutal as some of them are.
Here are a few specimens:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Women and horses must be beaten.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Women and money are the cause of all evil in the world.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Women only keep those secrets which they don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Trust no woman, and were she dead.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Between a woman’s yes and no there isn’t room for the point
of a needle.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you are too happy, take a wife.”</p>

<p class='c001'>When we read that “Montaigne is of that number, who,
through false gallantry, would keep woman in a state of ignorance,
on the pretext that instruction would mar her natural charms;”
and that the same author recommends poetry to women, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>it is “a wanton, crafty art, disguised, all for pleasure, all for
show, just as they are”; we recall with a smile John Stuart
Mill’s sarcastic reference to the time, “Some generations ago,
when satires on women were in vogue, and men thought it a
clever thing to insult women for being what men made them.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHRISTIANITY AND LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Christianity claims to be pre-eminently the religion of love,
in the widest sense of that term, including, especially, religious
veneration of a personal Deity and love of one’s enemy. It has
been asserted by Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and others that
Christianity has done little or nothing in aid of woman’s elevation;
and it cannot be denied that much good would have resulted if
more emphasis had been placed by the Apostles on certain phases
of the domestic relations. That Romantic Love is not alluded to
in the New Testament need not cause any surprise, for that
sentiment cannot have existed in those days when Courtship and
Individual Choice were unknown. But there are passages in St.
Paul’s writings which were probably the seeds from which grew
the mediæval contempt for marriage and women. And although
marriage is now zealously guarded by the Church, Love of the
romantic sort is no doubt looked upon even to-day by many an
austere clergyman as a harmless youthful epidemic—a sort of
emotional measles—rather than as a new æsthetico-moral sentiment
destined to become the strongest of all agencies working
for the improvement of the personal appearance, social condition,
and happiness of mankind.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, even agnostics must admit on reflection
that Christianity contained elements which, despite the vicious
fanaticism of many of its early teachers, slowly helped to
ameliorate woman’s lot. In the first place, Protestantism, as
embodied in Luther, performed an invaluable service by restoring
and enforcing universal respect for the marriage-tie. He set a
good example by not only defying the degrading custom of obligatory
celibacy, but by marrying a most sensible woman—a nun
who had escaped with eight others from a convent at Nimtsch.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mariolatry, or the cult of the Virgin Mary, is the second
avenue through which Christianity influenced the development of
the tender emotions. The halo of sanctity which it spread at the
same time over virginity and motherhood has been of incalculable
value in raising woman in the estimation of the masses.</p>

<p class='c001'>A third way in which Christianity influenced woman’s position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>is suggested by the following remarks of Mr. Lecky, who has
done valuable service to philosophy, in showing how emotions as
well as ideas change with time: “In antiquity,” he says, “the
virtues that were most admired were almost exclusively those
which were distinctively masculine. Courage, self-assertion, magnanimity,
and, above all, patriotism, were the leading features of
the ideal type; and chastity, modesty, and charity, the gentler and
the domestic virtues, which are especially feminine, were greatly
undervalued. With the single exception of conjugal fidelity, none
of the virtues that were highly prized were virtues distinctively or
pre-eminently feminine.” Now the “religion of love,” by especially
insisting on these “feminine virtues,” became a powerful agent
in undermining the coarse mediæval spirit with its masculine,
military “virtues,” <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>alias</i></span> barbarisms.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>CHIVALRY—MILITANT AND COMIC</h3>

<p class='c013'>In the howling wilderness of mediæval masculine brutality and
feminine degradation there was one sunny oasis in which the
flowers of Love were allowed to grow undisturbed for a few generations,—until
military ambition trod them again underfoot. This
brief episode of gentler manners is known as the period of
Chivalry.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ever since the fifth century the worship of the Virgin Mary
had increased in ardour, and it was to be expected that at some
favourable moment this adoration would be extended to the whole
female sex, or at least its nobler representatives. This was the
mission taken upon themselves by the knights and poets of
chivalrous times.</p>

<p class='c001'>Chivalry, it is true, was so often a mixture of clownishness and
licentiousness, its practice was so much less refined than its theory,
that in opposition to those historians who have sung its praises
others have doubted whether its influence was on the whole for
good or for evil. For, although the knights vowed especially to
protect widows and orphans, and respect and honour ladies, yet it
was precisely under their <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>régime</i></span> that, when cities were taken
and castles stormed, women were subjected to the most brutal
treatment.</p>

<p class='c001'>The difficulty is best solved by distinguishing between two
kinds of Chivalry—the Militant and the Poetic. The militant
type of knight-errantry was less inspired by the desire to benefit
womankind than by ambition to gratify silly masculine vanity. So
thoroughly was the mediæval mind imbued with ideas of war that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>these knights could not conceive even of love except in a military
guise. So they rode about the country in quest of adventure,
ostensibly in the service of an adored mistress, but really to find
an outlet, in times of peace, for pent-up military energy and
ambition.</p>

<p class='c001'>Spain and Southern France were the principal home of Chivalry
Militant, because there a warm climate and smiling nature offered
most favourable conditions to wandering knights in quest of
adventure. Fortunately the world possesses, in <cite>Don Quixote</cite>, a
lifelike picture of knight-errantry; for although the aim of Cervantes
was to make fun, not so much of Chivalry as of trashy
contemporaneous romances of Chivalry, yet in doing this he could
not avoid depicting the comic side of the institution itself, concerning
which it is indeed <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>difficile satiram non scribere</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>It appears to have been the custom of these knights to wander
about the country interfering in every quarrel, and, in default of a
disturbance, creating one.</p>

<p class='c001'>Each knight had a Dulcinea, whom he had perhaps never seen,
but in whose honour and for whose love he engages in all these
combats. And whenever he meets another knight he forthwith
challenges him to admit that this Dulcinea, whom the other has
of course never seen, is the most beautiful lady in the world. The
other knight echoes the challenge in behalf of <em>his</em> Dulcinea; and
the result is a combat in which the victor, by the inexorable
logic of superior strength, proves the superior beauty of his chosen
lady-love.</p>

<p class='c001'>The vanquished knight is then sent as prisoner to the victor’s
mistress with a message of love.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Germans do not often originate anything; but if they
take up an idea or institution they work it more thoroughly
than any other nation. So with the fantastic side of Chivalry,
which was introduced after the second crusade, during which
German knights had come into close contact with French knights.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Spain,” says Professor Scherr, “has imagined a Don Quixote,
but Germany has really produced one.”</p>

<p class='c001'>His name was Ulrich von Lichtenstein, and he was born in the
year 1200. “From his boyhood, Herr Ulrich’s thoughts were
directed towards woman-worship, and as a youth he chose a high-born
and, be it well understood, a married lady as his patroness,
in whose service he infused method into his knightly madness.
The circumstance that meanwhile he himself gets married does not
abate his folly. He greedily drinks water in which his patroness
has washed herself; he has an operation performed on his thick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>double underlip, because she informs him that it is not inviting for
kisses; he amputates one of his fingers which had become stiff in
an encounter, and sends it to his mistress as a proof of his capacity
of endurance for her sake. Masked as Frau Venus, he wanders
about the country and engages in encounters, in this costume, in
honour of his mistress; at her command he goes among the lepers
and eats with them from one bowl.... The most remarkable
circumstance, however, is that Ulrich’s own spouse, while her
husband and master masquerades about the land as a knight in
his beloved’s service, remains aside in his castle, and is only mentioned
(in his poetic autobiography) whenever he returns home,
tired and dilapidated, to be restored by her nursing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>When a German knight had chosen a Dulcinea, he adopted and
wore her colour, for he was now her <em>love-servant</em>, and stood to his
mistress in the same relation as a vassal to his master. “The beloved,”
Scherr continues, “gave her lover a love-token—a girdle
or veil, a ribbon, or even a sleeve of her dress; this token he
fastened to his helmet or shield, and great was the lady’s pride if
he brought it back to her from battle thoroughly cut and hewn to
pieces. Thus (in <cite>Parzival</cite>) Gawan had fastened on his shield
a sleeve of the beautiful Olibet, and when he returned it to her,
torn and speared, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘Da ward des Mägdlein’s Freude gross; ihr
blanker Arm war noch bloss, darüber schob sie ihn zuhand.’</span>”</p>

<p class='c001'>The attitude of the knight-errants may be briefly described as
<em>Gallantry gone mad</em>. We have seen that a few traces of Gallantry
are found in the pages of Ovid; but it was during the age of
Chivalry that this overtone of Love made itself heard for the first
time distinctly and loudly. And as, when a new popular melody
appears, everybody takes it up and sings and whistles it <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad nauseam</i></span>;
so these knights, intoxicated with the novel idea of gallant
behaviour toward women, took it up and carried it to the most
ridiculous extremes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The women, naturally enough, unused to such devotion, became
as extravagantly coy as the men were gallant. They subjected
this Gallantry to the most absurd and even cruel tests. The
knights were sent to war, to the crusades, into the dens of wild
animals, to test their devotion; and few were so manly as the
knight in Schiller’s ballad, who, after fetching his lady’s glove from
the lion’s den, threw it in her face, instead of accepting her willing
favours.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is with reference to these coy and cruel tests of Gallantry
that Wolfram von Eschenbach bitterly accuses Love of having
caused the death of many a noble knight.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Yet, despite these absurdities, the trials and procrastinations to
which the knights were subjected had one good result: they helped
to give Love a supersensual, imaginative basis. This fact is brought
out clearly in the following statement made by Dr. Bötticher in his
learned work on <cite>Parzival</cite>. When, he says, after the middle of the
twelfth century, the Troubadour love-poetry became known in
Austria, “it was especially the idea of Minnedienst (love-service)
that was seized upon with avidity: the knight wooes and labours
for a woman’s love, but she holds back and grants no favours until
after a long trial-service. The final object of this service, the
possession of the beloved, is regarded as <em>quite subordinate to the
pangs and pleasures of wooing and waiting</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here was a novelty in Love, indeed! And, as good luck
would have it, fashion lent its powerful aid to the innovation.
The sentiment was that “Whoever is not in the service of love is
unworthy to be a courtier”; and thus many a boor who would
have very much preferred to continue treating women as servants,
had to put his head into the yoke of Gallantry, in order to be
“fashionable.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHIVALRY—POETIC</h3>

<p class='c013'>If these knights of Chivalry bestrode their warlike Rosinantes
to show an astonished world for the first time what could be done
in the way of Gallantry, the peaceful poets of Chivalry—the
Troubadours and Minnesingers—in turn mounted their winged
Pegasus, and soared for the first time to the dizzy heights of
Ecstatic Adoration or Emotional Hyperbole.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Woman was regarded,” says Mr. Symonds, “as an ideal
being, to be approached with worship bordering on adoration.
The lover derived personal force, virtue, elevation, energy from
his enthusiastic passion. Honour, justice, courage, <em>self-sacrifice</em>,
contempt of worldly goods flowed from that one sentiment, and
love united two wills in a single ecstasy. Love was the consummation
of spiritual felicity, which surpassed all other modes
of happiness in its beatitude. Thus, Bernard de Ventadour
and Jacopo da Lentino were ready to forego Paradise, unless they
might behold their lady’s face before the throne of God. For a
certain period in modern history this mysticism of the amorous
emotion was no affectation. It formulated a genuine impulse of
manly hearts, influenced by beauty, and touched with the sense
of moral superiority in woman, perfected through weakness, and
demanding physical protection. By bringing the tender passions
into accord with gentle manners and unselfish aspirations, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>served to temper the rudeness of primitive society; and no little
of its attraction was due to the conviction that <em>only refined
natures could experience it</em>. This new aspect of love was due to
chivalry, to Christianity, to the Teutonic reverence for woman, in
which religious awe seems to have blended with the service of
the weaker by the stronger.”</p>

<p class='c001'>These remarks, though applicable to Chivalrous poetry in
general, refer especially to the Italian species. The most important
varieties of Chivalrous poetry, however, are those of the
Provençal, or French, Troubadours, and the German Minnesingers.
These must be briefly considered in turn, as they present national
differences of importance to the history and psychology of Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>a</i>) <em>French Troubadours.</em>—As we live in a period in which
the newspaper has become the greatest of moral forces, we can
most easily realise the social influence of the Troubadours on
reading, in Thierry, that “In the twelfth century the songs of the
troubadours, circulating rapidly from castle to castle, and from
town to town, supplied the place of periodical gazettes in all the
country between the rivers Isère and Vienne, the mountains of
Auvergne and the two seas.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The wandering minstrels who wielded this poetic power were
recruited from all classes—nobility, artisans, and clergy. But, as
Dr. F. Hueffer remarks in his entertaining work on Provençal
life and poetry, “By far the largest number of the Troubadours
known to us—fifty-seven in number—belong to the nobility, not
to the highest nobility in most cases, it is true. In several instances,
poverty is distinctly mentioned as the cause for adopting
the profession of a troubadour. It almost appears, indeed, as if
this profession, like that of the churchman, and sometimes in
connection with it, had been regarded by Provençal families as a
convenient mode of providing for their younger sons.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In a time when distinctions of rank were so closely observed,
it was perhaps of special importance that these singers should be
chiefly persons of noble blood. Women, it is true, have at all
times shown a disposition to ignore rank in favour of bards and
tenors; but the mediæval nobles might have hesitated, frequently,
to extend to commoners the unlimited hospitality of their castles,
and the privilege of adoring their wives in verse and action.
These husbands, in fact, appear to have shown remarkable forbearance
towards their poetic guests. No doubt it flattered their
vanity (overtone of <em>Pride</em>) to have the charms of their spouse
sung by a famous poet in person; and on account of the social
influence wielded by the Troubadours, owing to their successive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>appearance at all the castles in the land, it was, moreover, wise
not to forfeit their goodwill. Sometimes, however, Jealousy held
high carnival, as, in the case of Guillem, the hero of Hueffer and
Mackenzie’s opera, <cite>The Troubadour</cite>, who was murdered by the
injured husband, and the faithless wife compelled to drink of the
wine called “the poet’s blood,” adulterated in a horribly realistic
manner. The women, likewise, were frequently moved by Jealousy—not
in behalf of their husbands but of the Troubadours, of
whose art and adoration they desired a Monopoly, whereas these
bards were very apt to transfer their fickle affections to other
women.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fickleness, however, was not the greatest fault of these Troubadours.
Their great moral shortcoming was that they paid no
attention to the borderline between conjugal and romantic love.
Dr. Hueffer does not recollect a single instance amongst the
numerous love-stories told in connection with the Troubadours, in
which the object of passion was not a married lady—a strange
point of affinity with the modern French novel to which he calls
the attention of those interested in national psychology. A case
in point is that of Guirant (1260), one of whose pastorals is
analysed by Hueffer: “The idea is simple enough: an amorous
knight, whose importunate offers to an unprotected girl are kept
in check by mere dint of graceful, witty, sometimes tart reply.”
These offers of love are repeated at intervals of two, three, seven,
and six years, and finally transferred to the woman’s daughter,
always with the same bad luck. His own wife, meanwhile, is
never considered a proper object for his poetic effusions. Concerning
the German imitator of foreign customs—Ulrich von
Lichtenstein, mentioned a few pages back—we have likewise seen
that his wife never entered his mind except when he came home
“tired and dilapidated, to be restored by her nursing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides pastorals of the kind just referred to, the Troubadours
had several other classes of songs, among them the tensons, or
contentions which were “metrical dialogues of lively repartee on
some disputed points of gallantry.” These may have given
ground for the myth that aristocratic ladies of this period “instituted
Courts of Love, in which questions of gallantry were gravely
discussed and determined by their suffrages,” as, <i>e.g.</i> whether a
husband could really love his wife. The question whether any
such debating clubs for considering the ethics and etiquette of
love existed is still debated by scholars; but the best evidence
appears to be negative.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>b</i>) <em>German Minnesingers.</em>—The German wandering minstrels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>also belonged mainly to the aristocracy, and imitated their French
colleagues in paying their addresses chiefly to married women—a
fact for which, in both cases, the rigid chaperonage of the young
must be held responsible; for man <em>will</em> make love, and if not
allowed to do so properly he will do it improperly. Yet on the
whole the Minnesingers, at least in their verse, were less amorous
than the Troubadours. As Mr. L. C. Elson remarks in his
<cite>History of German Song</cite>: “The Troubadour praised the eyes,
the hair, the lips, the form of his chosen one; the Minnesinger
praised the sweetness, the grace, the modesty, the tenderness of
the entire sex. The one was concrete, the other abstract.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Abstractness, however, is not a desirable quality in poetry, the
very essence of which is concrete imagery. Accordingly we find
that with few exceptions the German Minnesingers are not as
poets equal to their French prototypes. It was Schiller himself
who passed the severest judgment on these early colleagues of his.
“If the sparrows on the roof,” he once remarked to a friend,
“should ever undertake to write, or to issue an almanac of love
and friendship, I would wager ten to one it would be just like
these songs of love. What a poverty of ideas in these songs!
A garden, a tree, a hedge, a forest, and a sweetheart—these are
about all the objects that are to be found in a sparrow’s head.
Then we have flowers which are fragrant, fruits which grow
mellow, twigs on which a bird sits in the sunshine and sings, and
spring which comes, and winter which goes, and nothing that
remains except—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ennui</i></span>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Schiller’s criticism, however, is too sweeping, for there were
notable exceptions to these sparrow-poets, concerning one of whom,
Hadlaub, the late Professor Scherer gives the following fascinating
information in his <cite>History of German Literature</cite>: "He introduces
human figures into his descriptions of scenery, and shows us, for
instance, in the summer a group of beautiful ladies walking in an
orchard, and blushing with womanly modesty when gazed at by
young men. He compares the troubles of love with the troubles
of hard-working men, like charcoal-burners and carters.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hadlaub tells us more of his personal experiences than any
other Minnesinger. Even as a child, we learn, he had loved a
little girl, who, however, would have nothing to say to him, but
continually flouted him, to his great distress. Once she bit his
hand, but her bite, he says, was so tender, womanly, and gentle,
that he was <em>sorry the feeling of it passed away so soon</em>. Another
time, being urged to give him a keepsake, she threw her needle-case
at him, and he seized it with sweet eagerness, but it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>taken from him and returned to her, and she was made to give it
him in a friendly manner. In later years his pains still remained
unrewarded; when his lady perceived him, she would get up and
go away. Once, he tells us, he saw her fondling and kissing a
child, and when she had gone he drew the child towards him and
embraced it as she had embraced it, and kissed it in the place
where she had kissed it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The gradual change in woman’s position, social and amorous, is
indicated by the differences between the earlier and the later
Minnesongs. In the early poems Professor Scherer remarks, "The
social supremacy of noble woman is not yet recognised, and the
man wooes with proud self-respect.... Another refuses himself
to a woman who desired his love.... A fourth boasts of his
triumphs. ‘<em>Women</em>,’ says he, ‘<em>are as easily tamed as falcons</em>.’
In another song a woman tells how she tamed a falcon, but he
flew away from her, and now wears other chains....</p>

<p class='c001'>“In the later Minnesongs it is <em>the women who are proud, and
the men who must languish</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A still more remarkable change is noticed in the German Folk-songs
which followed the periods of Minnesong proper. “The
women of these popular love-songs are not mostly married women;
<em>they are, as a rule, young maidens</em>” [at last, pure Romantic Love!]
“who are not only praised but also turned to ridicule and blamed.
The woes of love do not here arise from the capricious coyness of
the fair one, but are called forth by parting, jealousy, or faithlessness.
Feeling is stronger than in the Minnesong, and seeks
accordingly for stronger modes of expression.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not a mere accident that true Romantic Love should have
first appeared in these Folk-songs. For these were the products
of gifted individuals in the lower classes, where chaperonage—arch
enemy of Love—was less strict than among the higher classes.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>FEMALE CULTURE</h3>

<p class='c013'>That the women were not ungrateful to the mediæval bards
who first discovered in them the possibilities of higher charms and
virtues, is shown by their treatment of Heinrich von Meissen,
Minnesinger, who was called Frauenlob, because he constantly
sang the “praise of woman.” When he died at Mainz in 1317
they carried his bier to church with their own hands, and then, in
accordance with the custom of the time, poured libations of wine
on his bier so freely that the whole floor of the church was covered.</p>

<p class='c001'>And there is every reason to believe that the women of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Frauenlob’s period deserved his praises, because they were in
æsthetic, moral, and intellectual culture far superior to the women
before or directly after their time. We read in Gottfried von
Strassburg’s poem how Tristan, while Isolde healed his wound,
instructed her in the arts and manners of court life. Isolde knew
French and Latin besides her own language. She played the
violin and the harp, and sang; she wrote letters and poems, and
would indeed have been a model of culture even at the present day.
The twelfth century even had a genuine blue-stocking, the nun
Herrad von Landsberg, who wrote a cyclopædia of all human
knowledge, in the Latin tongue, called the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Hortus Deliciarum</cite></span>.
Learning throughout the mediæval ages was all concentrated in the
monasteries; but at the period in question the monks did not
retain everything for themselves, but aided the knights and the
poets in instructing the women of the court and nobility.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor did these women neglect their domestic affairs or physical
exercise. They accompanied the men on their falcon-hunting
parties, and at home learned to spin, weave, sew, and make clothing
for themselves and their husbands and children. At the tournaments
and other games they appeared as Queens of Beauty to
distribute prizes and inspire their admirers to heroic deeds; and
at banquets and other social gatherings they seem to have supplied
more of the wit and entertainment than the men, whose military
occupations left them less time for the cultivation of the arts.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time one cannot help smiling at the elementary
rules of conduct which had to be given even to women of the
nobility. You must not stare at a man long, or refuse to return
his salutation, young ladies were told; nor must you in walking
take too long or too short steps. A poet of the middle of the
thirteenth century (quoted by Mr. Hueffer) gives this advice to a
girl: “If a gentleman takes you aside and wishes to talk of courtship
to you, do not show a strange or sullen behaviour, but defend
yourself with pleasant and pretty repartees. And if his talk annoys
you and makes you uneasy, I advise you to ask him questions,”
and contradict his statements, in order “to give a harmless turn
to the conversation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Like Greek and Roman civilisation, like the palmy days of
Persian and Arabian culture, this mediæval period of feminine
ascendancy and refinement unfortunately did not last many generations.
Although, undoubtedly, chivalry accomplished real good
for the time being, most of what went by that name was, after
all, too much of a sham—less a matter of actuality than of poetic
fancy. “Sincere and beautiful as the chivalrous ideal may have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>been,” says Mr. Symonds, “it speedily degenerated. Chivalry,
though a vital element of feudalism, existed, even among the
nations of its origin, more as an aspiration than a reality. In
Italy it never penetrated the life or subdued the imagination of
the people. For the Italo-Provençal poets that code of love was
almost wholly formal.” Petrarch, like Alberti and Boccaccio,
indulges again in abuse of women as coarse and brutal as that of
the early “Christian Fathers”; and when we come to the sixteenth
century, the scholar Cornelius Agrippa complains of the old state
of affairs—woman’s complete subjection: “Unjust laws,” he says,
“do their worst to repress women; custom and education combine
to make them nonentities. From her childhood a girl is brought
up in idleness at home, and confined to needle and thread for sole
employment. When she reaches marriageable years, she has this
alternative: the jealousy of a husband, or the custody of a convent.
All public duties, all legal functions, all active ministrations of
religion are closed against her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The manner in which a great English poet, much later still,
treated the women of his household was quite in consonance with
the customs of preceding times. As an English author wrote, forty
years ago, “Milton taught his daughters to pronounce Greek and
Latin, so that they might read the classics aloud for his pleasure,
but forbade their understanding the meaning of a word for their
own—for which he deserved to be blind.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Regarding France we read in Compayré that “Even in the
higher classes, woman held herself aloof from instruction, and from
things intellectual. Madame Racine had never seen played, and
had probably never read, the tragedies of her husband.” Mme. de
Lambert “reproaches Molière for having excluded women from
recreation, pastime, and pleasure.” Fénelon advised girls to learn
to read and write correctly and to learn grammar, which “surpassed
in the time of Fénelon the received custom.” “No one knew
better than Fénelon the faults that come to woman through
ignorance—unrest, unemployed time, inability to apply herself to
solid and serious duties, frivolity, indolence, lawless imagination,
indiscreet curiosity concerning trifles, levity, and talkativeness,
sentimentalism, and ... a mania for theology: women are too
much inclined to speak decisively on religious questions.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>PERSONAL BEAUTY</h3>

<p class='c013'>Rarer even than feminine culture, Personal Beauty appears to
have been throughout the Middle Ages. Most of the portraits of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>women and men, as well as the ideal heads and figures in paintings
and sculpture, are repulsively ugly and inexpressive of higher traits.
The general causes of mediæval ugliness—neglect of personal
hygiene and sanitary measures, hard manual labour, prevention
of love-matches, etc.—will be considered elsewhere. In this place
only one cause need be alluded to. The old Church Fathers, it is
well known, were not only unæsthetic but positively anti-æsthetic.
Everything pleasing to the senses was denounced by them, especially
the physical beauty of women, which they looked upon as a
special gift of the devil. Such an attitude on the part of the
leading social class could hardly tend to encourage the cultivation
of personal charms; and during the trials for witchcraft special
efforts appear to have even been made to eliminate beauty forcibly;
for the mere possession of unusual beauty sometimes sufficed to
bring a poor girl to trial, outrage, torture, and death.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may have been due partly to a natural reaction against asceticism,
partly to the rarity of spiritual beauty, that the mediæval poets
in enumerating the charms of their mistresses, confine themselves
almost exclusively to their physical features. Professor Scherr,
after quoting Ariosto’s description of his heroine Alcina in <cite>Orlando
Furioso</cite> (vii. 11, <i>seq.</i>), for comparison with similar efforts of
German poets, observes: “It is very remarkable that, as in this
female portrait sketched by Ariosto, so with mediæval poets in
general, including those of Germany, the principal accent is placed
on the bodily charms of the women. Almost all sketches of this
kind are purely material. Intellectual beauty, as expressed in the
features, is barely mentioned. These old romanticists were much
more sensual than modern writers would have us believe.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>SPENSER ON LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>That Love, too, continued to be looked at from a material point
of view, long after the chivalric efforts to idealise it, is shown
strikingly by the way in which Spenser compares love with friendship
and family affection. In the fifth book of the <cite>Faery Queene</cite>
he asks—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Whither shall weigh the balance down; to wit,</div>
      <div class='line'>The dear affection unto kindred sweet,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or raging fire of love to womankind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or zeal of friends, combined by virtues meet?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Like an ancient Greek he decides in favour of friendship—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For natural affection soon doth cease,</div>
      <div class='line'>And quenched is with Cupid’s greater flame,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>But faithful friendship doth them both suppress,”</div>
      <div class='line in18'>(for)</div>
      <div class='line'>“<em>Love of soul doth love of body pass.</em>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Could anything attest better than this the general mediæval
ignorance of the psychic traits or “overtones” which constitute
Romantic Love?</p>

<h3 class='c014'>DANTE AND SHAKSPERE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Long before the day of Spenser there lived, however, in Florence,
a poet whose transcendent genius enabled him to feel and describe
for the first time the real romantic sentiment of Love. It is true
that some of the poets of Chivalry had before him attempted to
depict the supersensual, æthereal side of the passion. But their
portraits lacked the touch of realism: they described what they
imagined; Dante what he felt.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dante was born in 1265: Modern Love was born nine years
later—613 years ago. “Nine times already since my birth,”
says Dante, “had the heaven of light returned to the self-same
point almost, as concerns its own revolution, when first the
glorious lady of my mind was made manifest to mine eyes; even
she who was called Beatrice (she who confers blessing) by many
who knew not wherefore.... From that time onward, Love
quite governed my soul.... But seeing that were I to dwell
overmuch on the passions and doings of such early youth, my
words might be counted something fabulous, I will therefore put
them aside,” etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>These are the opening lines of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Vita Nuova</cite></span>, in which
Modern Love is for the first time portrayed with an air of sincerity,
and concerning which Professor C. E. Norton justly remarks that
“so long as there are lovers in the world, and so long as lovers are
poets, will this first and tenderest love-story of modern literature
be read with appreciation and responsive sympathy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>What a privilege to describe First Love not only in an
individual but a <em>historic</em> sense, as Dante did in this poem, which
Rossetti calls “the auto-biography or auto-psychology of Dante’s
youth, till his twenty-seventh year.”</p>

<p class='c001'>After that first sight of Beatrice one of her sweet smiles was
the highest goal of his desires; but so powerful was the spell of
her presence that he was obliged to avoid her. “From that night
forth the natural functions of my body began to be vexed and
impeded, for I was given up wholly to thinking of this most
gracious creature; whereby in short space I became so weak and
so reduced that it was irksome to many of my friends to look upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>me ... the thing was so plainly to be discerned in my countenance
that there was no longer any means of concealing it.” Such
words as “trembling,” “confusion,” “weeping,” constantly occur
as the narrative proceeds. Love, he says, “bred in me such
overpowering sweetness that my body, being all subjected thereto,
remained many times helpless and passive.” When for the first
time Beatrice denied him her smile, “I became possessed with
such grief that, parting myself from others, <em>I went into a lonely
place</em> to bathe the ground with most bitter tears.” And in one
of the sonnets interspersed he says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“My face shows my heart’s colour,</div>
      <div class='line'>No sooner do I lift mine eyes to look</div>
      <div class='line'>Than the blood seems as shaken from my heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all my pulses beat at once and stop.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But by far the most remarkable thing in the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Vita Nuova</cite></span>, is
Dante’s own indirect testimony that such Love as he felt, such
supersensual, æsthetic Love, <em>was a novelty and a puzzle to his
contemporaries</em>. For he tells how he met some ladies who gazed
at him and laughed till one of them asked: “To what end lovest
thou this lady, seeing that thou canst not support her presence?
Now tell us this thing that we may know it: for certainly the
end of such a love must be worthy of knowledge.”</p>

<p class='c001'>No doubt it was worth knowing; for, as the author of the
admirable article on “Poetry,” in the eighth edition of the <cite>Encyclopædia
Britannica</cite> (1859), remarks: “When in modern times
the attempt was made to revive tragedy, it proved totally
unsuccessful until this principle (of romantic love) was admitted
into the drama to give it warmth and life. Of that species of
composition which in its proper sense is peculiar to the moderns,
viz. the novel and romance, it forms, as we all know, the moving
power. In short, it influences, more or less, every department in
which the imagination has exerted itself with success since the
revival of literature.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Once more it is well to state that there are geniuses in the
emotional as in the intellectual world. Dante was both; and the
realistic descriptions he has given of the effects of Romantic Love
have helped to sustain the notion that Love is immutable, and has
existed at all times. But the indirect testimony to the contrary
just quoted, and the whole argument of this chapter on Mediæval
Love, make it apparent that Dante’s Love was the exception
which proves that among the others Love did not exist. And
even Dante was not entirely modern in his Love. A modern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>lover would not have attempted to conceal the object of his Love,
but would have made it apparent to all by his foolish actions that
he was in Love with this particular girl and no other; he would
perhaps have wooed more persistently, and his feelings would not
have remained unchanged after her marriage to another. Like
Petrarch, moreover, Dante cannot be quite acquitted of the
suspicion that, after the first flush of excitement, the excessive
and persistent purification and idealisation of his passion was
based not so much on real amorous feelings and motives, as on an
author’s craving for an object on which to lavish his literary art
of embellishment.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dante, in a word, hyper-idealised his passion. He became
quite deaf to the fundamental tone of Love, and heard only its
overtones. And herein lies his inferiority to Shakspere. It is in
the works of Shakspere that the various motives and emotions
which constitute Love—sensuous, æsthetic, intellectual—are for
the first time mingled in proper proportions. Shakspere’s Love is
Modern Love, full-fledged, and therefore calls for no separate
analysis. It is a primitive passion, purified and refined by
intellectual, moral, and æsthetic culture. And though by no
means universal, or even common, at the present day, it is yet of
frequent occurrence, and will become more and more prevalent as
time rolls on. To facilitate its progress by pointing out its
characteristics, its evolution, and the measures that must be taken
to foster it, is one of the principal objects of this monograph.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>MODERN LOVE</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>A BIOLOGIC TEST</h3>

<p class='c013'>Writers on evolution have a very simple and convenient way
of verifying their inferences, by applying the rule—which seems
to hold true universally—that the different stages through which
an individual passes in his development—physical and mental—correspond
to the periods of development through which the whole
race has passed.</p>

<p class='c001'>This principle, applied to our present problem, fits exactly, and
proves that the account given in the preceding pages of the
development of Love is correct.</p>

<p class='c001'>Historically we have seen that of all affections Maternal Love
is the earliest and (until after Romantic Love appears) the
strongest. Then paternal, filial, and fraternal love are gradually
developed, followed by friendship (Greek), and finally by Love proper.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Just so with the individual. The baby’s first love is for its
mother, whose tender expression and beaming eyes throw the first
reflected smile on its face, and touch the first cord of sympathetic
attachment. Then the father comes in for his share of attention,
followed by sisters and brothers. At school begins the era of
friendship, representing “classical” love, and often as ardent and
Love-like as among the ancient Greeks. Finally Romantic Love
appears on the scene, eclipsing every other emotion. And, like
historic Love, it generally passes through a blind, silly, chivalric
stage, known as “calf-love,” which at last is succeeded by real,
intense romantic passion, that leads to monogamous marriage, the
central pillar of modern civilisation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not only have we seen that Romantic Love is the latest and
the strongest of all affections, but the causes which retarded its
development have been indicated. Chief among these were the
negation of Individual Preference, and the absence of opportunities
for Courtship, already deplored by Plato. As long as women
were captured, or bought, or disposed of by father or mother
without any reference to their own will, Sexual Selection on the
female’s part was of course out of the question; and on the man’s
part it was rendered impossible by the absence of Courtship.
Wooing a woman was not winning <em>her</em> favour, but impressing her
father with a display of wealth or social power. Thus there were
no opportunities on her part for the display of personal charms or
the cunning art of Coyness, or for inflaming and feeding his
passion through Jealousy by bestowing an occasional mischief-making
smile on his rivals; there were no lover’s quarrels
followed by sweet reconciliations and an increase of Love; no
short absences fanning Love with sighs; no alternate feelings of
hope and despair, inspired by his or her fickle or uncertain actions;
no chance for displays of Gallantry and mutual Self-sacrifice and
assistance; no sympathetic exchange and consequent doubling of
pleasures, real or anticipated; none, in fact, of the more subtle
traits and emotions which make Romantic Love what it is.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VENUS, PLUTUS, AND MINERVA</h3>

<p class='c013'>It cannot be said that these obstacles to Love have been as
radically removed as they ought to be. Oriental chaperonage is
still rampant in France, to the extinction of all true romantic
sentiment. In other countries Parental Tyranny has considerably
abated, but the Goddess of Love still has formidable rivals in
Plutus, the god of wealth, and Minerva, the goddess of “wisdom”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>or expediency. Thus it happens that even in the case of persons
who are refined enough to experience Love, it is too often absent
when they marry; and, as a German pessimist sneeringly points
out, no one has yet dared to tempt bride and bridegroom to
perjury, by asking when the knot is tied, “Do you <em>love</em> this
woman?” “Do you <em>love</em> this man?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless public sentiment is continually making war on
Plutus and Minerva, and siding with Venus. Probably the
mercantile element in marriage will not die out till a few weeks
before the millennium, although Herbert Spencer is optimistic
enough to believe it will sooner. “After wife-stealing,” he says,
“came wife-purchase; and then followed the usages which made,
and continue to make, considerations of property predominate over
considerations of personal preference. Clearly, wife-purchase and
husband-purchase (which exists in some semi-civilised societies),
though they have lost their original gross form, persist in disguised
forms. Already some disapproval of those who marry for money
or position is expressed; and this growing stronger may be
expected to purify the monogamic union, by making it in all cases
real instead of being in some cases nominal.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is indeed a most hopeful sign of progress, this strong and
growing modern sentiment in favour of Romantic Love as against
rival motives matrimonial. Novelists, when the wills of the
lovers and the parents clash, invariably and unconsciously side
with the lovers; and should a novelist make an exception, many
of his readers would close the book, and the others would finish it
under protest and disappointedly. Even when we read a newspaper
reporter’s thrilling and dramatic narrative of the elopement
of a foolish young couple, fresh from the high-school, our hearts
throb with sympathetic anxiety lest the irate parent should
succeed in capturing the runaway couple.</p>

<p class='c001'>No doubt this instinctive modern prejudice in favour of
Romantic Love will ultimately throw a halo of sacredness around
it, which will raise Cupid’s will to the dignity of an Eleventh
Commandment—a consummation devoutedly to be wished; for
although the conjugal affection which grows out of Romantic Love
is not always deeper than that which results from unions not
based on Love, the physical and mental qualities of the children
commonly show at a glance whether or not the parents were
brought together by Sexual Selection.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>LEADING MOTIVES</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The psychic elements of Love which thus far have been
compared to overtones, might also be regarded from a Wagnerian
point of view as <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Leitmotive</i></span> or leading motives in the Drama of
Historic Love. In the first scenes, where the actors are animals
and savages, followed by Egyptians, Hebrews, Hindoos, Greeks,
and Romans, and mediæval clowns and fanatics, these leading
motives are heard only as short melodic phrases, and at long
intervals, pregnant, indeed, with future possibilities, but isolated
and never combined into a symphony of Love. In the last act,
however, which we have now reached, all these motives appear in
various combinations, in the gorgeous and glowing instrumentation
of modern poets, with all possible figurative, harmonic, and
dynamic nuances; and at the same time so intertwined and interwoven
that no one apparently has ever succeeded in unravelling
the poetic woof and distinguishing the separate threads. For us,
however, who have followed these motives from the moment when
they first appeared in a primitive form, it will be easy to distinguish
them and subject each one to a separate analysis. We
shall first consider those which, like Coyness and Jealousy, are
already familiar and need only be considered in their modern
forms, and then pass on to those which are more and more
exclusively modern.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>MODERN COYNESS</h3>

<p class='c013'>At least five sources or causes of modern female Coyness may
be suggested:—</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <em>An Echo of Capture.</em>—Why are modern city-folks so fond
of picnics? It was Mr. Spencer, I believe, who suggested somewhere
that it is because picnics awaken in civilised men and
women a vague and agreeable reminiscence of the time when their
ancestors habitually took their meals on meadows in the shade of
a tree. If it is possible for such experiences to re-echo, as it were,
in our nervous system through so many generations, thanks to the
conservatism of oft-repeated cerebral impressions, then it does not
seem so very fantastic to suggest that one cause of female Coyness
may be a similar echo, or reminiscence, of the time when the
primitive ancestresses of modern women were “courted” by
Capture or Purchase, and so badly treated as wives that in course
of time an instinctive impulse was formed in their minds to shrink
back and say No to man’s proposals.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>(2) <em>Maiden</em> versus <em>Wife</em>.—It is hardly necessary, however, to
rely upon such a remote sociological echo, so to speak, for an
explanation of a girl’s hesitation to become a wife even if her
suitor pleases her. The thought of exchanging her maiden freedom
for conjugal restrictions and duties; of giving up the homage
and admiration of all men for the possible neglect of one; of
probably soon losing her youthful beauty, etc.—such thoughts
would make many girls even more coy than they now are, did not
the fear of becoming an old maid act as a counterbalancing motive
in favour of marriage.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <em>Modesty.</em>—Esquimaux girls, as we have seen, “affect the
utmost bashfulness and aversion to any proposal of marriage, lest
they should lose their reputation for modesty.” And the greatest
analyst of the human heart puts the same philosophy into the
mouth of Juliet in a passage which, although everybody knows it
by heart, must yet be quoted here—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in22'>“O gentle Romeo,</div>
      <div class='line'>If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:</div>
      <div class='line'>Or if thou think’st I am too quickly won,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll frown and be perverse and say thee nay,</div>
      <div class='line'>So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.</div>
      <div class='line'>In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,</div>
      <div class='line'>And therefore thou may’st think my ’haviour light:</div>
      <div class='line'>But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true</div>
      <div class='line'>Than those that have more <em>cunning to be strange</em>.</div>
      <div class='line'>I should have been more strange, I must confess,</div>
      <div class='line'>But that thou overheard’st, ere I was ware,</div>
      <div class='line'>My true love’s passion: therefore pardon me,</div>
      <div class='line'>And <em>not impute this yielding to light love</em>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which the dark night hath so discovered.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>(4) <em>Cunning to be Strange.</em>—No huntsman (except a monarch)
would care to go to an enclosure and shoot the deer confined
therein, nor a fisherman to catch trout conveniently placed in a
pond. But to wade up a mountain brook all day long, climbing
over slippery rocks, and enduring the discomforts of a hot sun and
wet clothes, with nothing to eat, and only a few speckled trifles
to reward him—that is what he considers “glorious sport.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The instinctive perception that a thing is valued in proportion
to the difficulty of its attainment is what taught women the
“cunning to be strange.” Seeing that they could not compete
with man in brute force, they acquired the arts of Beauty and of
Coyness, as their best weapons against his superior strength—the
Beauty to fascinate him, the Coyness to teach him that in Love,
as in fishing, the <em>pleasure of pursuit</em> is the main thing.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>At first this Coyness was manifested in a very crude manner,
as among the primitive maidens who hid in the forest; or among
the Roman women celebrated by Ovid, who locked their door and
compelled the lover to beg and whine for admission by the hour;
or among the mediæval women who, to gratify their caprices and
enjoy the sense of a newly-acquired power, sent their admirers to
participate in bloody wars before recognising their addresses.
And so coarse-grained were the men that as soon as the women
ceased to tease they ceased to woo; as, for instance, in mediæval
France, about the time of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Chansons de Geste</cite></span>, “the man who
desires a woman yet does not appear as a wooer; for he knows he
is certain of her favour,” as we read in Ploss. Hence Cleopatra’s
brief and pointed rejoinder to Charmian when he advises her, in
order to win Antony’s love, to give him way in everything, cross
him in nothing: “Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose
him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>(5) <em>Procrastination.</em>—Love at first sight is frequent at the
present day, but in ancient Greece and Rome marriage at first
sight appears to have been more common. The classical suitor’s
wooing was generally comprised in three words: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Veni, Vidi,
Vici</i></span>; <i>i.e.</i> I Came, Saw the girl’s father, Conquered his scruples
by proving my wealth or social position. Sufficient brevity in
this, no doubt: but <em>brevity is not the soul of Love</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tant plus le chemin est long dans l’amour, tant plus un
esprit délicat sent de plaisir,” says Pascal, announcing a truth of
which ancient and mediæval nations had no conception until
female Coyness taught it them. Goethe evidently had the same
truth in mind when he mentioned as a phase of ancient love
(Roman <cite>Elegies</cite>)—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In der heroischen zeit, da Götter und Göttinen liebten</div>
      <div class='line'>Folgte Begierde dem Blick folgte Genuss der Begier.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>That is, in prose, there were no preliminaries in the love-drama,
which had only one act, the fifth, in which the marriage is
celebrated.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Goldsmith on Love.</em>—In Goldsmith’s <cite>Citizen of the World</cite> there
is a chapter on “Whether Love be a Natural or Fictitious Passion,”
in which reference is likewise made to the value of procrastination.
As this passage shows Goldsmith to have been the first author who
had an approximate conception of the development and psychology
of Love, I will quote it almost entire. It is in the form of a
dialogue, and one of the speakers remarks: "Whether love be
natural or no ... it contributes to the happiness of every society
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>in which it is introduced. All our pleasures are short and can
only charm at intervals; love is a method of protracting our
greatest pleasure; and surely that gamester who plays the greatest
stake to the best advantage will, at the end of life, rise victorious.
This was the opinion of Vanini, who affirmed that ‘every hour
was lost which was not spent in love.’ His accusers were unable
to comprehend his meaning; and the poor advocate for love was
burned in flames; alas! no way metaphorical. But whatever
advantages the individual may reap from this passion, society will
certainly be refined and improved by its introduction; all laws
calculated to discourage it tend to embrute the species, and weaken
the state. Though it cannot plant morals in the human breast,
it cultivates them when there: pity, generosity, and honour receive
a brighter polish from its assistance; and a single <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>amour</i></span> is sufficient
entirely to brush off the clown.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But it is an exotic of the most delicate constitution: it
requires the greatest art to introduce it into a state, and the
smallest discouragement is sufficient to repress it again. Let us
only consider with what ease it was formerly <em>extinguished in
Rome</em>, and with what difficulty it was <em>lately revived in Europe</em>:
it seemed to sleep for ages, and at last fought its way among us
through tilts, tournaments, dragons, and all the dreams of chivalry.
The rest of the world, <em>China only excepted</em>, are, and have ever
been, utter strangers to its delights and advantages. In other
countries, as men find themselves stronger than women, they lay
a claim to rigorous superiority: this is natural, and love, which
gives up this natural advantage, must certainly be the effect of art—an
art calculated to lengthen out our happier moments, and add
new graces to society.”</p>

<p class='c001'>To this conclusion the lady interlocutor in the dialogue objects
on the ground that “the effects of love are too violent to be
the result of an artificial passion”; and suggests, by way of
accounting for the absence of love, that “the same efforts that
are used in some places to suppress pity, and other natural
passions, may have been employed to extinguish love”; and
that “those nations where it is cultivated only make nearer
advances to nature.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Goldsmith thus leaves it in doubt whether he considers Love a
natural or an artificial passion. In the three passages which I
have italicised, he errs: first, in saying that Love was “extinguished”
in Rome, when in fact it never existed there, except
incompletely in the poetic intuition of Ovid and possibly one or
two other poets; secondly, he errs in remarking that it was lately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>“revived” in Europe, when in fact it was newly-born; and his
excepting China, in speaking of the absence of Love, can only be
looked on in the light of a joke in view of the absolute subjection
of women to parental dictation, and the fact that, as one writer
remarks, “a union prompted solely by love would be a monstrous
infraction of the duty of filial obedience, and a predilection on the
part of the female as heinous a crime as infidelity.” But his
definition of Love as “the effect of art—an art calculated to
lengthen out our happier moments and add new graces to society”
is exceedingly good. The art in question is known as Courtship:
and it is the latest of the fine arts, which even now exists in its
perfection in two countries only—England and America. The
Italian language has no equivalent for Courtship, as Professor
Mantegazza tells us in his <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Fisiologia dell’ Amore</cite></span>; and a German
commentator on this passage in Mantegazza comments dubiously:
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Das Eutsprechende deutsche Wort <em>dürfte wohl</em> Werbung sein;”</span>
“the corresponding German word is presumably <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Werbung</i></span>.”
“Presumably” is very suggestive. Yet the Germans have another
expression of mediæval origin apparently, namely, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Einem Mädchen
den Hof machen”</span>—"to pay court to a girl," which, though somewhat
conversational, has evidently the same historic origin as our
word Court-ship; implying that formerly it was the custom at
court alone to prolong the agony of Love by gallant attentions to
women, which enabled them to exercise the “cunning to be
strange.”</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Disadvantages of Coyness.</em>—Beneficial as are no doubt the
effects which have been brought about by female Coyness in
developing the art of Courtship, there are corresponding evils
inherent in that mental attitude which make it probable that
Coyness will gradually disappear and be succeeded by something
more modern, more natural, more refined.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are four serious objections to Coyness, one from a masculine,
three from a feminine point of view.</p>

<p class='c001'>Men, in the first place, can hardly approve of Coyness; for it
certainly indicates a coarse mediæval fibre in a man if he is obliged
to confess that he can love a girl not for her beauty and amiability,
but only because she tantalises and maltreats him:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,</div>
      <div class='line'>The more it grows and fawneth on her still.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Or, in Heine’s delightful persiflage of this attitude—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Ueberall wo du auch wandelst,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schaust du mich zu allen Stunden,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Und jemehr du mich misshandelst,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Treuer bleib ich dir verbunden.</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Denn mich fesselt holde Bosheit</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wie mich Güte stets vertrieben;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Willst du sicher meiner los sein</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Musst du dich in mich verlieben.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In one English sentence: Your amiability repels, your malice
attracts me; if you wish to get rid of my attentions, you must fall
in love with me.</p>

<p class='c001'>If a refined man can feel ardent affection for an animal, a friend,
a relative, without being “spurned” and consequently “fawning,”
why should not the same be true of his love for a beautiful girl?
It is true; and hence the cleverest women of the period, feeling
this change in the masculine heart, have adopted a different
method of fascinating men and bringing them to their feet, as we
shall presently see.</p>

<p class='c001'>Women, in turn, are injured by Coyness; first, because it makes
them act foolishly. French and German girls are systematically
taught to take immediate alarm at sight of a horrid man (whom
they secretly consider a darling creature, with <em>such</em> a moustache)
and conceal themselves behind their mamma or chaperon, like
spring chickens creeping under the old hen at sight of a hawk.
This sort of <em>spring-chicken coyness</em> does infinitely more harm than
good; it makes the girls weak and frivolous, and as for the men,
if they are systematically treated as birds of prey, how can they
avoid falling in with their <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>rôle</i></span>? If men are to behave like gentlemen
they must be treated as gentlemen, as they are in England
and America.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coyness, again, makes women deceitful and insincere.
“Amongst her other feminine qualities,” says Thackeray of one of
his characters, “she had that of being a perfect dissembler.” And
in another place, “I think women have an instinct of dissimulation;
they know by nature how to disguise their emotions far
better than the most consummate courtiers can do.” It cannot
be said that dissimulation is a virtue, though it may be a useful
weapon against coarse and selfish men. If not the same thing as
hypocrisy, it is next door to it; and it cannot have a beneficial
effect on a woman’s general moral instincts if she is compelled constantly
to act a part contrary to her convictions and feelings.
Though as deeply in love as her suitor, she is commanded to treat
him with indifference, coldness, even cruelty,—in a word, to do
constant violence to her and his feelings, and to lacerate her own
heart perhaps even more than the unhappy lover’s. Thus instead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>of mutually enjoying the period of Courtship, and indulging in
harmless banter, “they gaze at each other fiercely, though ready
to die for love”; or, as Heine puts it—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Sie sahen sich an so feindlich,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Und wollten vor Liebe vergehen.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And why all this perverseness, this unnaturalness, this emotional
torture? Simply because—once more be it said—the men of
former days, the men who lived on pork and port, who delighted
in bear-baiting, cock-fights, and similar æsthetic amusements, had
nerves so coarse and callous that to make any impression on them
the women had to play with them as a cat does with a mouse to
make it tender and sweet.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Coyness lessens Woman’s Love.</em>—One more charge, the gravest
of all, remains to be piled on top, as a last crushing argument
against crude Coyness. An emotion, like a plant, requires for its
growth sunshine, light, and open air; if kept in a dark cellar and
stifled, it soon becomes weak and pale and languishes. Man’s
superior strength and selfish exercise of it have compelled women
to cultivate Coyness as an art of dissembling, hiding, and repressing
their real feelings. But to repress the manifestations of anger, of
pity, of Love, is to suppress them; hence Coyness has necessarily
had the effect of weakening woman’s Love. It weakens it in the
same proportion as it strengthens man’s. And hence, as I have
said before, the current notion that women love more ardently,
more deeply, than men is an absurd myth. The poets have always
shown a predilection for this, as for all other myths; and as it is
still served up as a self-evident truth in a thousand books every
year, it is worth while to clear away the underbrush and let in
some daylight on the subject.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Masculine</em> versus <em>Feminine Love</em>.—One thing may be conceded
at the outset: that woman’s Love, when once kindled, is apt to
endure longer than man’s. Shakspere’s “’Tis brief, my Lord, as
woman’s love” is therefore a libel on the sex. The difficulty is
to get it under way. It takes so much of the small kindling
wood of courtship (“sparking” it is called) to set a female heart
aflame, that many men give it up in despair and remain bachelors;
or else, like the young man in <cite>Fidelio</cite>, they finally tell their girl,
“If you will not love me, at least marry me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It may also be conceded that Rousseau exaggerates when he
says that “Women are a hundred times sooner reasonable than
passionate: they are as unable to describe love as to feel it.”
This may have been true in his day; but that there have since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>been some female authors who have correctly described Love, and
thousands of women who have been deeply in Love, it would be
absurd to deny. All that is here maintained is that Love is of
less frequent occurrence in women than in men; and when it
does occur in women it is not usually so deep, so passionate, so
maddening. The average woman knows little of Romantic Love.
She has read about it in novels, in poems, and thinks how delightful
it must be. The faintest symptom is taken for an attack, just
as in perusing a medical book people commonly fancy they have
symptoms of the disease they chance to be reading about. Thus
it happens that young girls so easily “fall in love,” as they
imagine, and are ready to elope with the first music teacher or
circus rider that comes along—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A blockhead with melodious voice</div>
      <div class='line'>In boarding-school may have his choice,</div>
      <div class='line'>And oft the dancing-master’s art</div>
      <div class='line'>Climbs from the toe to touch the heart.”—<span class='sc'>Swift.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is quite probable that Coleridge was right when he wrote—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For maids as well as youths have perished</div>
      <div class='line'>From fruitless love too fondly cherished;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>although this does not seem to agree with the opinion of Shakspere
and Thackeray regarding the rarity of broken lovers’ hearts.
Morselli’s work on Suicide does not contain any definite statistics
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>à propos</i></span>; but I have seen the statement in a newspaper that in
Italy, during 1883, thirty-six men and nine women committed
suicide—four to one; and the proportion will appear larger still if
it is remembered that girls often commit suicide from an anguish
deeper than a refusal.</p>

<p class='c001'>The myth that woman’s passion is deeper than man’s is commonly
expressed in the form given to it by Byron: that in man’s
life love is only an episode, whereas to a woman it is all in all.
Allowing for poetic exaggeration, it does not at all follow that
because a man does not brood all his life over Love, he therefore
loves less. The fact that Goethe, the poet, also wrote treatises on
botany and physics, and made landscape sketches, did not decrease
the depth of his poetic feeling but added to it. For it is a fundamental
law of psychology—except in pathologic cases—that
continuous brooding over an emotion weakens and exhausts it;
but after intervals of rest it emerges more fresh than ever. The
various objects and ambitions that occupy man only serve to
strengthen his feelings, his capacity for Love. That women are
more easily swamped and carried away by emotions does not prove
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>their feelings to be deeper, but themselves to be weaker. One
lake may be entirely full, and yet not contain half as much water
as a larger lake which is only half-full.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was evidently with a vague desire to justify or excuse
woman’s comparative weakness in Love that Ninon de L’Enclos
wrote “Women and flowers are made to be loved for their beauty
and sweetness, rather than themselves to love.” And that intelligent
observer Mrs. Childs adds the weight of her feminine testimony
by confessing her belief “That men more frequently marry
for love than women.”</p>

<p class='c001'>To remove all lingering doubt, consider the “overtones” of
Love separately. Is woman ordinarily as absurdly or ferociously
Jealous as man, or quite so Proud of her conquest? Is she so
deeply absorbed in Admiration of his Personal Beauty? Is she as
Gallant, and as ready for Sacrifices? or does she not rather take
his devoted services for granted, and consider them rewarded by a
smile or some other trifle? Indeed, the only element of Love
which in woman is stronger than in man is Coyness; and Coyness,
as has been shown, weakens woman’s Love in the same degree as
it increases man’s.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of course it would be unjust to attribute to the effects of
Coyness all the difference between man’s and woman’s Love.
Much is due to the physiologic law that emotional capacity—amorous
included—depends on brain capacity (<em>not</em> on the “heart”);
and man’s brain is more powerful than woman’s. But crude
mediæval Coyness must bear a large share of the blame; and it is
probable that now, having played its <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span> of bringing men to terms
and making them gallant and polite towards women, it will disappear
gradually.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Der Mohr hat seine Schuldigkeit gethan, Der Mohr kann
gehen.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Already, however, there is, especially in America and England,
a superior class of women who, despising Coyness as crude, artificial,
and silly, have adopted in its place a much more refined
method of making men fall in love with them. In one word,
they have substituted Flirtation for Coyness. As this statement
will to many appear paradoxical, if not absurd, it is necessary
first to distinguish between Flirtation and Coquetry before trying
to justify it.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Flirtation and Coquetry.</em>—These two words are so constantly
confused by careless or ignorant writers that some girls are almost
as much offended if accused of Flirtation as of Coquetry. It was
bad enough for Winthrop to say that “A woman without coquetry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>is as insipid as a rose without scent, champagne without sparkle,
or corned beef without mustard” (!), but there is no excuse whatever
for “Ik Marvel’s” saying that “Coquetry whets the appetite;
flirtation depraves it. Coquetry is the thorn that guards the
rose (!), easily trimmed off when once plucked. Flirtation is like
the slime on water-plants, making them hard to handle, and when
caught only to be cherished in slimy waters.” No excuse, I say,
because the dictionaries on our table tell us the very reverse.
Flirtation, in Webster, is simply “playing at courtship,” without
any cruel intentions; while Coquetry is an attempt “to attract
admiration, and gain matrimonial offers, from a desire to gratify
vanity, and with the intention to reject the suitor.”</p>

<p class='c001'>That this is the correct definition is shown beyond question
by the adjectives which are commonly coupled with those nouns:
a “harmless Flirtation,” a “heartless Coquette.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A Coquette seeks to fascinate for the sake of fascinating. Like
a miser, she mistakes the means for the end, and feeds on one-sided
passion and admiration, until one morning she wakes up and
finds her beauty gone, and herself the most disappointed and
unamiable of old maids. Or again, she might be compared to a
bank clerk who refused his salary because he was satisfied with
the tinkling of the money which he heard all day long. The Flirt,
on the other hand, displays her accomplishments, her wit, and
personal charms, for the sake of enlarging the facilities of Courtship,
the possibilities of rational Choice.</p>

<p class='c001'>One reason why Flirtation and Coquetry are so apt to be confounded
is because the English peoples alone have the word
Flirtation—naturally enough, as they alone allow their young
people the blessings of Courtship and rational choice promoted by
it. Foreigners, not appreciating exactly what is meant by the
word, are apt to translate it as Coquetry. One Frenchman, who
has lived long in England, has tried to define Flirtation for his
countrymen by saying it consisted of “attentions without intentions.”
This definition was widely welcomed as very clever.
Clever it may be, but it is a definition of Coquetry not of Flirtation.
For Flirtation never excludes <em>possible</em> intentions.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Flirtation</em> versus <em>Coyness</em>.—Flirtation, from the feminine point
of view, may be defined as <em>the art of fascinating a man and leaving
him in doubt whether he is loved or not</em>. There is no reason
why a beautiful and bright girl should not charm, <i>i.e.</i> flirt with,
every man who interests her, and to whom she has been properly
introduced. No reason why she should not dispense her sweet
smiles with complete impartiality, until she has made up her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>mind whom she wishes to marry. In so far as Coyness simply
means reserve and dignity, she will of course still be coy; but she
will not run away to conceal herself in the forest, or lock the
front door, or hide behind a chaperon’s back, or affect to be cynically
indifferent to men, or treat the one she likes best with
affected cruelty. With refined men of the period Flirting, <i>i.e.</i>
fascinating and leaving in doubt, is quite as effective in kindling
adoration to ecstasy as crude Coyness was with the coarse-fibred
men of the past. Flirtation, indeed, is much more tantalising
than Coyness, and therefore a complete modern substitute for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a passage in Hume’s <cite>Dissertation on the Passions</cite>
which, though occurring in a different connection, strikes home
the truth of the last sentence most forcibly. “Uncertainty,” he
says, “has the same effect as opposition. The agitation of the
thought, the quick turns which it makes from one view to another,
the variety of passions which succeed each other, according to the
different views: all these produce an agitation in the mind; and
this agitation transfuses itself into the predominant passion.
Security, on the other hand, diminishes the passions. The mind,
when left to itself, immediately languishes; and in order to preserve
its ardour, must be supported every moment by a new flow
of passion.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Of course to those of a girl’s admirers who are for a while left
in doubt and finally “get left” altogether, female flirtation may
seem a cruel pastime. But there is a sort of <em>historic justice</em> in
this torture which, indeed, almost amounts to an excuse for
<em>Coquetry</em>; it is a species of feminine revenge for the long centuries
of slavery in which muscular man held weak woman.
Besides, no man has ever died of a broken heart, except in novels.
And, again, who is to blame a pretty girl for having fascinated an
unsuccessful lover? A rose yields its fragrance and beauty to all
who wish to admire it. If a conceited young man comes along,
imagines that all its beauty is for him alone, and tries to pluck it,
he has only himself to blame if he feels the thorn of disappointment.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Lord Chesterfield wrote, “I assisted at the birth of that
most significant word ‘flirtation,’ which dropped from the most
beautiful mouth in the world,” he perhaps hardly realised how
very significant a factor of social life Flirtation was destined to
become. Mr. Galton wrote, not long ago, that without female
Coyness “there would be no more call for competition among the
males for the favour of the females; no more fighting for love in
which the strongest male conquers; no more rival display of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>personal charms in which the best-looking or best-mannered prevails.
The drama of courtship, with its prolonged strivings and
doubtful success, would be cut quite short, and the race would
degenerate through the absence of that sexual selection for which
the protracted preliminaries for love-making give opportunity.”
When Mr. Galton wrote this, he did not apparently realise the
social revolution that is going on, or understand that frank and
natural Flirtation, which recognises every man as a gentleman
until he has proved the contrary, affords much better opportunity
for Sexual Selection and “protracted preliminaries of love-making”
than crude, hypocritical, unnatural Coyness, which regards every
gentleman as a beast of prey and a libertine.</p>

<p class='c001'>Flirtation being the modern art of widening the field of amorous
competition and prolonging the duration of Courtship, it follows
that there cannot be too much of it—quantitatively speaking.
Qualitatively it easily degenerates into frivolity, as in the case of
those girls who get engaged repeatedly before marriage, which
shows a lack of judgment, of tact, and especially of delicacy,
because a peach should never be touched on the tree but allowed
to retain its first blush for the man who is to eat it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Refined flirtation, in truth, requires much more wit, more tact
and culture, than Coyness, or than Prudery, which is the north-pole
of Coyness. Prudery bears much resemblance to the artificial
dignity of a certain class of young men who, by means of persistent
reticence, gain a reputation for aristocratic and cynical
superiority. Coquetry even is preferable to Prudery, for it is at
any rate entertaining.</p>

<p class='c001'>To sum up this matter in one sentence: The coy Prude says
No, even when she means Yes; the cold Coquette says Yes and
always means No; the modest and refined Flirt says neither Yes
nor No, but looks and smiles a sweet “Perhaps—if you can win
my Love.”</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Modern Courtship.</em>—What a grotesque and topsy-turvy parody
of history it is, this modern comedy of Courtship, in which the
man is the slave and walks on his knees! And how gracefully
the newly-crowned girl-queen plays her <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span>, little suspecting that
in the next act the husband will probably throw away his self-assumed
mask, and insist again on his historic rights as lord and
master of the household!</p>

<p class='c001'>The shock which follows this transition from the romance of
Courtship to the realism of conjugal life is much the greatest in
the case of the Prude. The Coquette need not be considered;
she was born without a heart, and marriage will not give her one.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>But the Prude often owes her unnaturalness solely to an absurd
educational system, and may be at heart the best of women.
Previous to marriage she is taught to rely on passive Coyness to
arouse the desires of man. After marriage, when she yields herself
up, body and soul, she loses this weapon, the lover recovers
his courage and lowers the pitch of his devotional ecstasy. This
alarms the girl, who eagerly endeavours to recover the romantic
Adoration by trying to please and coax and caress. But pleasing—or
<em>active</em> fascination—being an art which she never has practised,
she does it in a bungling way—overdoes it, in fact—thus
increasing the husband’s indifference. Had she learned the art of
refined Flirtation, <i>i.e.</i> active fascination with wit and accomplishments,
this domestic tragedy would never have been enacted.
Her skill and tact would then have enabled her to preserve her
husband’s Gallantry, by supplying a constant variety and novelty
in those feminine charms and graces in which a superior woman is
as fertile as a man of genius in ideas.</p>

<p class='c001'>By her extremely reserved and passive attitude during Courtship
the Prude not only mars the probabilities of conjugal happiness,
she also weakens her own Love directly, through Coyness,
and indirectly, by making the man too servile and over-anxious to
worship. For if a man immediately yields up his sword and proclaims
himself fatally stabbed by a white wench’s black eye, there
can be in her mind none of those small obstacles and doubts
which, like short absences, increase Love. Love-making should
be a duel of wit and mutual fascination. The Flirt does her part
of the fencing; the Prude simply hides behind her shield and
waits to see if the man can break it, or coax her to throw it away.
With a Flirt a man need not be a servile worshipper, but he may
be a Flirt likewise: which is a much more desirable attitude,
not only because male flirtation will fan the woman’s Love into a
brighter flame through the stimulus of uncertainty, but also
because it enables the man to preserve his dignity. Hence
Beatrix’s pointed advice to Henry Esmond: “Shall I be frank
with you, Harry, and say that if you had not been down on your
knees, and so humble, you might have fared better with me?
A woman of my spirit, cousin, is to be won by gallantry and not
by sighs and rueful faces. All the time you are worshipping
I know very well I am no goddess, and grow weary of the
incense.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The girl of the period is the girl who flirts, and who expects
every eligible man to take up her challenge for a tournament of
wit and playing at Courtship. The reason why there is much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>more Romantic Love in America and England than in other
countries is because there is more Flirtation, more opportunity for
Courtship. On the Continent young folks are too constantly
regarded from the marriage point of view. In Italy and France,
when a young lady comes back from boarding-school, she is
married as quickly as possible before she has had a chance to fall
in love with a man of her choice. Consequence: she falls in love
<em>after</em> marriage, and not always with her husband. In Germany a
young lady is allowed to see young men and even to walk with
them in the street, in the daytime or in the evening, if properly
chaperoned; but under no circumstances will she take a young
man’s arm, for that would imply an engagement. In America it
is otherwise; but even there, in the South, it is taken for granted
that if a young man calls on a young lady three or four times he
can have no other object than to marry her. His object may be
to marry, but not necessarily <em>her</em>. What he wants is to become
acquainted, and if acquaintance “by summer’s ripening breath”
blossoms into Love, so much the better; if not, it is a thousand
times better he should be allowed to depart in peace than that
two beings should be mated who do not feel really sympathetic
and companionable. How is a young man to find his Juliet if he
is not allowed to see a number of women, without being called
fickle? And how is Juliet to find her Romeo, if mothers frighten
young men into bachelorhood by such absurd customs?</p>

<p class='c001'>The word Courtship, in fact, should have a wider meaning
than it has now. It should be almost synonymous with Flirtation,
which provides the means of bringing together, from a wide
circle of acquaintances, two beings who are really suited to each
other, instead of two whom blind chance, a few “calls,” or the
advantages of intimacy resulting from cousinship, have fortuitously
mated for a life of probable conjugal misery.</p>

<p class='c001'>Plato’s advice that opportunity should be given to the sexes to
become acquainted before marriage is much more followed to-day
than at any previous time in the world’s history; but there is
still vast room for improvement.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>MODERN JEALOUSY</h3>

<p class='c013'>Jealousy may be defined as a painful emotion on noticing, or
imagining, that some one dear to us loves another more than us.
Unlike affection in general, and like sympathy, it therefore necessarily
refers to a sentient being and a possible reciprocation of
affection. It is a form of rivalry, of which there are two kinds:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>rivalry for the possession of an object or a position; and rivalry
for the first place in a person’s affections. The first is not incompatible
with friendship, for two rival candidates for a political
office or a college fellowship are not necessarily personal enemies.
But the second kind, which, when allied with doubt is called
Jealousy, is a deadly enemy of good-will; and there is probably no
cause that has broken so many friendships as the “green-eyed
monster,” among women no less than among men.</p>

<p class='c001'>Modern psychology agrees with St. Augustine that “he that
is not jealous, is not in love.” There can be no love without
Jealousy—potential at any rate, for in the absence of provocation
it may perhaps never manifest itself. But there can be Jealousy
without love, <i>i.e</i> without sexual love; for that passion is often
aroused in connection with other kinds of affection—parental,
filial, etc. Stories are told of dogs practically committing suicide
by disappearing or pining away if displaced by a younger pet in
the affection of a family; and those who have seen specimens of
canine jealousy find nothing improbable in these stories. Yet as
a rule all these general forms of jealousy—as when a husband is
jealous of his wife if the children show her special favour, or as
when a mother is jealous of a visitor loved by her children—are
mere trifles compared with sexual Jealousy, romantic and conjugal.
It is in painting this form of Jealousy that poets have exhausted
the strength of language. “Of all the passions in the mind thou
vilest art,” says Spenser of this “king of torments,” “the injured
lover’s hell.” With this, when once the lover’s mind is affected—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“’Tis then delightful misery no more,</div>
      <div class='line'>But agony unmixt, incessant gall.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But, O, what damnéd minutes tells he o’er</div>
      <div class='line'>Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In the animal kingdom sexual Jealousy and rivalry play so
important a part that Darwin attributes to their agency the
superior size and strength (in most classes) of the male over the
female. Among savages, as has been pointed out, we see sometimes
a curious absence of Jealousy, both as regards brides and
wives; whereas in other cases, the passion manifests itself with
brutal ferocity. Thus among the American Indians infidelity is
sometimes punished by cutting off the nose, sometimes by the
shearing of the hair, which is considered a great disgrace. On the
Fiji Islands, Waitz tells us, the wives of a polygamist “lead a life
of bitter strife and commit ... the most atrocious cruelties
against one another from hate and Jealousy; biting or cutting off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>the nose is quite a common occurrence.” Stanley, in his work on
the Congo, remarks that the Langa-Langa women scar their faces
and busts in a hideous manner, probably because compelled to do
so by the Jealousy of the men. In Hebrew literature the case of
Jacob’s two wives urging him of their own accord to become still
further polygamous, presents a strange example of this passion
being neutralised by other motives. What prompted the ancient
Greeks, and what prompts Oriental nations to this day, to keep
their women under lock and key, was, and is, of course, simply a
perverse and ignorant feeling of Jealousy. In this feeling also, no
doubt, originated the Chinese custom compelling women to mutilate
their feet to prevent them from going about; as well as the custom
indulged in until recently by Japanese ladies of shaving off their
eyebrows and blackening their teeth after marriage—a custom
which shows how much stronger Jealousy must be than Admiration
of Personal Beauty in the affection of these nations. No doubt,
however, all these excesses and cruelties of Jealousy are counter-balanced
by the good it has done in enforcing the laws of morality.</p>

<p class='c001'>Civilisation does not weaken sexual Jealousy, but only gives it
a less brutal form of manifesting itself. Conjugal Jealousy still
produces the greatest number of domestic tragedies, of which
<cite>Othello</cite> is the immortal type. It is already typified in Hera, for, as
Zeus says in Homer, “She is always meddling, whatever I may be
about.” But then she had good cause to meddle in the affairs of
this Olympian Don Juan.</p>

<p class='c001'><cite>Lovers’ Jealousy.</cite>—As for Lovers’ Jealousy proper, there is
reason to believe that it will grow stronger and more common as
general culture advances. For the men who are most ahead of our
century emotionally, the men of genius, are usually very jealous.
Heine’s Jealousy went so far that he even poisoned a poor parrot
of whom his Mathilde was extravagantly fond; and it is probable
that Byron’s savage attack on the Waltz was dictated by a sort of
wholesale Jealousy in regard to all pretty girls. For in Love
Byron was omnivorous.</p>

<p class='c001'>The lover’s and the husband’s Jealousy are alike in their
extreme sensitiveness—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“Trifles light as air</div>
      <div class='line'>Are to the jealous confirmations strong</div>
      <div class='line'>As proofs of holy writ;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>nor is there probably any difference in the intenseness of their agony.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the lover Jealousy is not only his greatest torture, but also
his deadliest enemy. With this fever in his blood even the man
of the world who knows his “Ars Amoris” by heart, is apt to ruin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>his cause by excess of blind rivalry and clumsy passion: which
perhaps explains why so many great men have been refused by
their best loves. To endure and ignore a rival is, as Ovid already
declared, the highest and most difficult achievement in the Art of
Love; as for himself, he frankly admits, he was unequal to it.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are several ways in which lovers ruin their chances by
awkward excess of passion. It makes them appear selfish and
unamiable; and the pallor which Jealousy inspires is not that
which makes a girl consider a man “interesting,” and leads her
through pity to Love. If the lover is not yet accepted, his
Jealousy arouses her opposition, because he seems to take it for
granted that he has a right to be jealous, and that she will necessarily
accept him. Again, his attitude repels her by suggesting
that he would indulge in impertinent supervision and tyrannical
dictation after marriage. Even if he has successfully proposed,
she does not like to have him make his victory and prospective
ownership so conspicuous by his jealous glances and man&oelig;uvres.
Besides, a fascinating girl likes to preserve her apparent freedom
as long as possible, and let others admire her beauty while it lasts.</p>

<p class='c001'>Most fatal is it for a man to assume a jealous attitude towards
a woman before he has been able to inspire her with interest in
him. Her indifference will thus be inevitably changed into positive
dislike. For, as Madame de Coulanges says, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“L’on ne veut
de la jalousie que de ceux dont on pourrait être jalouse”</span>—We do
not desire any jealousy except from those for whom we could ourselves
feel jealousy. Stendhal, who quotes this aphorism, adds a
reason why women may be gratified by a display of Jealousy:
“Jealousy may please proud women, as a new way of showing
them their power.” And to a woman in love and in doubt, the
man’s Jealousy, which is so easily detected, is of course a most
welcome symptom of conquest.</p>

<p class='c001'>For Jealousy is the first sign of Love, as it is also the last. If
a man is in doubt whether he is really in Love with a girl or only
admires her beauty, let him observe her when talking or dancing
with another man: if he then feels “queer”—from a mere uneasiness
to a desire to pulverise the other fellow—he may be assured
that his emotion has passed the borderline which separates disinterested
æsthetic admiration from the desire for exclusive possession
which is popularly known as Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>Conversely, if a man who has been repeatedly refused, or who
for some other reason endeavours to suppress his passion, feels in
doubt whether the cure is complete, he need only imagine his
former love in the arms of another man, or before the altar with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>him: if that does not make him turn pale and frown and bite his
lips, he is cured. This test, however, is not so certain as the
other, for sometimes Jealousy outlives Love; and Longfellow
believed that every true passion leaves an eternal scar.</p>

<p class='c001'>Like Coyness, Jealousy is a discord in the harmony of Love.
A little of it is piquant and rouses desire. “Jealousy,” says
Hume, “is a painful passion, yet without some share of it the
agreeable affection of love has difficulty to subsist in all its force
and violence.... Jealousy and absence in love compose the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>dolce
piccante</i></span> of the Italians, which they suppose so essential to all
pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Unfortunately, Jealousy is rarely content to remain “agreeably
piquant,” but is apt to grow into a tornado of passion which
devastates body and soul, and makes it the keenest agony known
to mankind. It is often said that the agony inspired by a refusal
is the only thing that excuses tears in a man. This agony is a
mixed emotion, including wounded Pride and the sense of having
lost all that makes life worth living. But its keenest sting comes
from the green-eyed monster, who hisses into the lover’s ears that
now a rival will enjoy her sweetness and beauty. Dante did not
correctly describe the lowest depth of hell: it is this thought in
the lover’s mind that “now another will marry her.” It is <em>that</em>
thought which drives lovers to lunatic asylums and suicide.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Some lines I read the other day,” Keats wrote to Fanny
Brawne, "are continually ringing a peal in my ears—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To see those eyes I prize above mine own</div>
      <div class='line'>Dart Favours on another—</div>
      <div class='line'>And those sweet lips (yielding immortal nectar)</div>
      <div class='line'>Be gently press’d by any but myself—</div>
      <div class='line'>Think, think, Francesca, what a cursed thing</div>
      <div class='line'>It were beyond expression.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“Get thee to a nunnery,” would be every lover’s advice to the
girl who rejected him. If she obeyed, his agony would be
diminished one-half.</p>

<p class='c001'>But why, if he cannot have her, should she not make some one
else happy? Because Jealousy is the one absolutely selfish trait
of Love. The lover who in other respects is the very model of
altruism and Self-Sacrifice is in point of jealous rivalry for possession
an absolute egotist to whom even <em>her</em> happiness is torture if
he cannot share it. Is this an aberration of Lovers’ Sympathy, or
does it mark its climax? The answer will be found in the chapter
on Sympathy.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Retrospective and Prospective Jealousy.</em>—There are three kinds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>of modern Jealousy—Retrospective, Present, and Prospective.
The rejected lover’s Jealousy is of the third kind; it refers not to
what is, but to what will or may be. Another variety of Prospective
Jealousy is illustrated by a story told in a Moscow journal
of an old peasant who married a young girl of whom he was very
jealous. On his deathbed he expressed a desire to give her a last
kiss. But hardly had she touched him, when he seized her under
lip and fastened his teeth so tightly in it that a knife had to be
used to pry them open. With his dying breath he confessed that
his object had been to mutilate her, so that no one else might
marry her.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is it not possible that the custom of burning widows in India
was at first an outcome of the Jealousy of some influential ruler
who set the fashion?</p>

<p class='c001'>Present Jealousy does not call for any special remarks, but
Retrospective Jealousy has some curious features. It is entirely
non-existent not only among those savage tribes who scorn virgin
brides, but among some semi-civilised peoples in Africa and Asia
where the men prefer to marry women with a dowry, no matter
how they may have earned it.</p>

<p class='c001'>In modern love Retrospective Jealousy is often very strong,
especially in men who, though they do not hesitate to marry a girl
who has been engaged before, would not care to dwell on the
details of the previous engagement. Women, too, have been
known to indulge in this futile form of Jealousy. Thus Heine
relates in one of his letters that at the special request of his
Mathilde, he got her a copy of the French edition of his <cite>Pictures
of Travel</cite>. “But hardly had she read a few pages, when she
turned deadly pale, trembled in all her limbs, and begged me for
heaven’s sake to close the book. She had come upon a love-scene
in it, and jealous as she is, she does not even want me to have
adored another <em>before</em> her <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>régime</i></span>; indeed, I had to promise her
that in future I would not address any language of love even to
the imaginary ideal personages in my books.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The trouble with Heine is that one never knows exactly when
he is relating facts and when indulging in fun and fiction. As a
rule, certainly women are not much troubled by Jealousy regarding
the past. If the lover promises to be a good boy in future and
give them a monopoly of his adoration, they are rarely disquieted
by the question, “Has he been in love before?” Indeed, there is
a current notion that women admire a man all the more for being
a Don Juan or professional lady-killer. Perhaps, however, this is
putting the cart before the horse: for, instead of admiring him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>because he is a lady-killer, is it not possible that he is a lady-killer
because they all admire him?</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet some truth there seems to be in that old notion regarding
gay Lotharios; for the average woman’s ideal man still wears a
certain mediæval military cast: he is conceived as a muscular
dare-devil, reckless, irresistible, a universal conqueror of female
hearts as well as of other fortresses.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Jealousy and Beauty.</em>—As Love becomes more and more
idealised, <i>i.e.</i> transferred to the imagination, its overtones combine
and produce various new emotional clang-tints—sometimes
agreeable, sometimes harsh and dissonant. Among the Japanese
and Chinese, as just stated, Jealousy neutralises the Admiration
of Personal Beauty to such an extent as to breed indifference to
shaved eyebrows, black teeth, deformed feet, and a consequent
utter absence of grace in gait. But there is a more subtle way in
which Jealousy may cast a cloud on Personal Admiration, even in
a refined Western imagination. Once in a while it happens to a
sensitive man, a worshipper of Beauty, that he beholds a vision of
grace and loveliness—perhaps in a ballroom, perhaps in a theatre
or the street. But this sight instead of delighting him, gives him
a painful sting in the heart. Partly, this paradoxical sadness of a
discoverer may be due to the sudden fancy that this fairylike
being perhaps will never again cross his field of vision. Yet it
seems more likely that the tinge of pain which o’ercasts the rosy
feelings of Admiration is due to Jealousy, especially if she is seen
in company with a man. For a moment the Beauty-worshipper
fancies himself in that man’s place; the next moment the consciousness
of isolation flashes on his mind, and the reaction brings
out the painful contrast between what is and what might be.
For man, as Mr. Howells has remarked, is still imperfectly monogamous.
He has occasional visions of a Mahometan heaven
peopled with black-eyed Houris; or envies the knight in Heine’s
poem, who lies on the beach and enjoys the caresses of the mermaids,
who come and kiss him because they know not that he only
pretends to be asleep.</p>

<p class='c001'>That the Beauty-worshipper’s sadness is due to a vague Jealousy
seems the more probable from the fact that the same feeling never
tinges his admiration of a living Apollo of masculine perfection.
Whether women ever have the same emotions remains for them
to tell.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>MONOPOLY OR EXCLUSIVENESS</h3>

<p class='c013'>In the case of this trait of Love, <a id='corr133.44'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Prior-ity'>Priority</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_133.44'><ins class='correction' title='Prior-ity'>Priority</ins></a></span> of discovery obviously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>belongs to the author of these lines—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Love, well thou knowest, no partnership allows,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cupid averse rejects divided vows.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Monopoly, the imperious desire for exclusive devotion and
possession, is the mother of Jealousy. Though less grim and
melancholy than her son, she is equally presumptuous and
meddlesome, and woe to the man who will so much as breathe or
smile upon what she claims as hers. Monopoly, like Jealousy, is
one of the selfish elements of Love. All lovers join hands and
declaim in unison the words of Jean Paul: “What pleases us is
to see her shrink from everybody else, growing hard and frozen to
them on our account, handing <em>them</em> nothing but ices and cold
pudding, but serving <em>us</em> with the glowing goblet of love.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Historically, Monopoly is of the utmost significance, since in it
is rooted monogamy, which, as previously explained, probably
originated in exogamous Capture giving a man the right to exclusive
possession of one woman in communities where, as one
writer puts it, every man might claim “a thousand miles of
wives.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The desire for exclusiveness, for undivided worship, sometimes
enters into non-sexual affections; and an anonymous writer has
suggested that the main reason why Byron was so devoted to his
dog was because the dog was “a creature exclusively devoted to
himself, and hostile to every one else.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet all this is child’s play compared with the imperious form
Monopoly assumes in Modern Romantic Love. In the fever-heat
of his passion the lover’s chief desire is to be cast on a desert
island, and remain there all alone with her. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“On ne se soucie
plus de ce que dit le monde,”</span> says Pascal; public opinion is
scorned; all social feelings annihilated. Relatives and friends
exist no longer—what are they to him? his pet occupations bore
him; and there is only one thought which fascinates—the picture
of a small and cosy house, all his own, a small parlour with one
sofa, barely large enough for two, a book of poems in very fine
print, compelling two heads to touch in reading from it, and a
breakfast-table with only two chairs; all visitors excluded from
the unsocial atmosphere, because “three are a crowd.” ’Tis a
“double selfishness,” doubly as strong as single selfishness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Surely Emerson—as the German professor did with the camel—evolved
his idea of a lover from his inner consciousness. “All
mankind love a lover,” he exclaims. Obviously he had never
seen a lover. The fact is that all the world thinks a lover a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>tremendous and ridiculous bore—a man whose whole mind is
monopolised by one unvarying topic—<em>her</em> perfections and <em>his</em>
chances of winning her; and who stubbornly insists on monopolising
<em>your</em> attention, too, with that everlasting exclusive topic.
Like every other lunatic he has one fixed idea; and it’s no wonder
the poets always paint him blind, like Cupid; for on the wide,
wide ocean of humanity, he sees nothing with his two big eyes
but one little solitary transient bubble.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this matter, it must be admitted, woman’s Love is superior
to man’s. “Oh, Arthur,” says Ella, in the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Fliegende Blätter</cite></span>,
“how happy I would be alone with you on a quiet island in the
distant ocean!” “Have you any other desire, dearest Ella?”
“Oh yes, do get me a season ticket for the opera.”</p>

<p class='c001'><em>True Love is transient.</em>—Boswell tells us that Johnson “laughed
at the notion that a man can never be really in love but once,
and considered it a mere romantic fancy.” And though this
romantic fancy is as current as ever in society and literature,
Johnson was right in his verdict, as usual.</p>

<p class='c001'>True Love, indeed, is absolutely exclusive of every other Love
<em>while it lasts</em>; but it rarely lasts more than two or three years;
and then the heart, freed from one monopoly, is ready for another,
perhaps even more tyrannical, <em>while it lasts</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>That Love is transient is most fortunate, for it is, in its truest
and most ardent form, such a consuming fever, that the strongest
man would not be able to endure its mingled ecstasies and anguish
more than a few years. The lover’s fancies are his only food;
coarser nourishment he scorns; he loses his appetite, and becomes
“pale and interesting”—to women, who like to see a powerful
man thus wincing under their superior might, and melting away
before their radiant beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet its transitoriness detracts not in the least from the magic
and the charm of Love. It is in the life of man what the flowering
period is in the life of a plant. As, for the sake of its fragrant
blossoms, a plant is tenderly nursed and watered weeks and
months though it flowers but a week; so, even if brief Love were
the only flower of life, yet would life be worth living for its sake alone.</p>

<p class='c001'>How long Love may last depends on individuals and circumstances.
Sainte-Beuve, I believe, has said that it never can outlive
five years. Favouring circumstances are slight obstacles,
rivalries and jealousies, short absences, etc.; while long absences,
the distractions of travel, professional occupations, etc., tend to
shorten it. In uninterrupted absence, without epistolary encouragement,
the most ardent Love would hardly survive a year,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>unless the lover lived on a desert island, with no other woman to
engross his attention. Return, however, is apt to bring on a
relapse, as with Henry Esmond, who “went away from his mistress,
and was cured a half-dozen times; he came back to her side,
and instantly fell ill again of the fever.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus it is the fate of all unrequited Love to die for want of
food; or, if successful, to leave the stormy ocean of passion and
sail into the more tranquil haven of conjugal affection.</p>

<p class='c001'>Woman’s Love is less transient than man’s, because there are
fewer ambitions to neutralise it.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Is First Love best?</em>—If Love’s Monopoly lasted for life, if
passion were not transient, it would follow that most men would
marry, or endeavour to marry, the schoolgirls who were the first
object of their amorous attentions. But is there one man in a
hundred, is there one in three hundred, who marries his first
Love? Cases are known of men of genius who fell in love at an
age varying from six to nine years; and there are few lads, in
America at any rate, and if they have an artistic temperament,
who do not have their cases of “calf-love,” beginning with their
tenth or twelfth year.</p>

<p class='c001'>A boy’s first Love is a girl of about his own age, towards
whom he shyly makes his way by offering her an apple, a bunch
of wild strawberries, or a large hailstone picked up during a storm
before her eyes, to impress her with his reckless Gallantry and
courage. The second and third loves—for schoolboys are fickle,
and schoolgirls more so—are probably not different in character
from the first. At fifteen and sixteen, boys scorn girls of their own
age, and fall in love with young married women, Troubadour-like.
Perhaps the Dulcinea is a Spanish beauty, with large thrilling
black eyes, who, seeing the poor cub’s infatuation, teases and tortures
him to distraction with her unfathomable wealth of fascination.</p>

<p class='c001'>And let no one imagine that these cases of early passion are
anything short of true Romantic Love. For follow that poor boy
enamoured of the Spanish brunette; see him hiding himself in a
lonely forest, gazing with rapture on her photograph—perhaps only
with his mind’s eye—throwing himself on the ground in an anguish
of tears, wishing that either <em>he</em> was dead ... or her husband
... and behaving altogether like a premature Werther.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such is calf—beg pardon—first Love. And is this first Love
best of all? Perhaps, in one respect, and in one only: it believes
in its own unchangeableness. Goethe remarks in his autobiography
that nothing is so calculated to make us disgusted with life “as
a return of Love.... The notion of the eternal and infinite,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>which forms its basis and support, is destroyed; it appears to us
transitory, like everything that recurs.”</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Heine on First Love.</em>—Heinrich Heine, whose poetry is next to
Shakspere’s the most valuable depository of Modern Love, enlarges
on this question in his fragmentary but admirable Analysis of
Shakspere’s Female Characters: "Love is a flickering flame between
two darknesses ... [the dots are in the original]. Whence
comes it?... From sparks incredibly small.... How does it
end?... In nothingness equally incredible.... The more
raging the flame, the sooner it is burnt out.... Yet that does
not prevent it from abandoning itself entirely to its fiery impulses,
as if this flame were to burn eternally....</p>

<p class='c001'>"Alas, when we are seized a second time in life by the grand
passion, we lack this faith in its immortality, and painful memories
tell us that in the end it will consume itself. Hence the melancholy
by which second differs from first love.... In first love
we fancy our passion can only end with death; and indeed, if the
threatening difficulties in our way cannot be removed in any other
manner, we readily make up our mind to accompany our beloved
to the grave.... But in second love the thought occurs to us
that time will change our wildest and most ecstatic feelings to a
tame, apathetic state; that these eyes, these lips, these contours,
which now throw us into transports of rapture, will some day be
regarded with indifference. This thought, alas! is more melancholy
than a presentiment of death.... It is a disconsolate
feeling, in the midst of intoxication, to think of the sober, frigid
moments that will follow, and to know from experience that these
ultra-poetic, heroic passions will have such a lamentably prosaic
ending....</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not, in the least, presume to find fault with Shakspere,
yet cannot but express my surprise that he makes Romeo enamoured
of Rosaline before he brings him face to face with Juliet. Though
absolutely devoted to his second love, there yet dwells in his soul
a certain scepticism, which finds utterance in ironic expressions,
and not rarely reminds one of Hamlet. Or is second love the
stronger in a man for the very reason that it is paired with lucid
self-consciousness? A woman cannot love twice, her nature is too
tender to endure a second time the terrific emotional earthquake.
Look at Juliet! Would she be able a second time to endure those
ecstatic delights and horrors, a second time suppress her fear and
empty the dreadful cup? In my opinion once is enough for this
poor, blessed creature, this pure martyr to a great passion.”</p>

<p class='c001'><em>First Love is not best.</em>—Thus even Heine, while lamenting the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>transitoriness of Love, cannot help suggesting that in man, at any
rate, second Love may be stronger than first. On this point it is
curious to note the difference of opinion among thoughtful writers.
La Bruyère declares that “we can love well once only—the first
time; the loves which follow are less involuntary.” Another
French author, Letourneau, on the contrary, thinks that one love-affair
only whets the appetite for more: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“on a besoin de vivre
fort;”</span> and hence “an expiring passion ordinarily leaves the ground
admirably prepared for the germination of another passion.”
Stendhal held that a young girl of eighteen, “owing to her inadequate
experience of life, is not comprehensive enough in her desires
to be able to love with as much passion as a woman of <a id='corr138.12'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='twenty-eight;'>twenty-eight;”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_138.12'><ins class='correction' title='twenty-eight;'>twenty-eight;”</ins></a></span>
and a lady-friend having objected to this on the ground
that in her first love a girl must love more ardently because her
feelings are not distracted by doubt and distrust, as they are subsequently,
he replied that this very <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>méfiance</i></span>, in its struggle with
love, will make it come out a thousand times more brilliant and
substantial than the gay and thoughtless first <a id='corr138.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='love.'>love.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_138.18'><ins class='correction' title='love.'>love.”</ins></a></span> Mr. P. G.
Hamerton seems to cast his vote in the same urn, for he thinks,
“it is, indeed, one of the signs of a healthy nature to retain for
many years the freshness of the heart which makes one liable to
fall in love, as a healthy palate retains the natural early taste for
delicious fruits.” And, finally, George Eliot asks: “How is it
that the poets have said so many fine things about our first love,
so few about our later love? Are their first poems their best? or
are not those the best which come from their fuller thought, their
larger experience, their deeper-rooted affections? The boy’s flute-like
voice has its own spring charm; but the man should yield a
richer, deeper music.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So doctors evidently disagree. But the facts that Heine is in
doubt, that the greatest authority makes Romeo’s unparalleled
passion his second love, and that even Werther’s famous love, notwithstanding
Goethe’s theory, is not his first, certainly make the
scale incline in favour of a second or later passion.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,</div>
      <div class='line'>And young affection gapes to be his heir;</div>
      <div class='line'>That fair for which love groaned for, and would die,</div>
      <div class='line'>With tender Juliet matched, is now not fair.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>These last two lines suggest the whole psychology of First Love.
Romeo’s first Love was not his best Love. When his soul had
reached manly maturity, and looked about for a proper object of
affection, he did not at once have the good luck to encounter his
Juliet. Rosaline was the <em>nearest approach</em> to his ideal; so he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>worked himself into a semi-fictitious passion and groaned for her,
and would die, until suddenly he saw his real ideal, and found that
his first passion was a fragile soap-bubble in comparison to his true
Love for Juliet, which no rival could have altered one speck.</p>

<p class='c001'>In his first Love, in a word, he had <em>fallen in love with the
species</em>, rather than with an individual. Sexual Selection, or
Individual Preference, had come in more as a matter of chance
than of decisive, final choice. And so it is with most cases of first
love. Man falls in Love with woman, woman with man, not with a
particular man or woman. Thus it is that at an early age thousands
of impatient youths marry their Rosalines before they have had
time or opportunity to meet their Juliets. Doubtless there is a
Juliet for every man in the world; but it generally happens that
she does not attend the same school, work in the same manufactory,
or live in the same village, or belong to the same city-clique as he
does; so, being less adventurous than Romeo, who went outside of
his clique for a sort of exogamous marriage by Capture, he weds
his first Love, <i>i.e.</i> his Rosaline; and this is one of the reasons why
so few cases of true Romantic Love are encountered even to-day,
outside of novels.</p>

<p class='c001'>Most marriages, in truth, are brought about through accidental
acquaintance or companionship, not through Love. Suppose that
a score of young men who have never loved were cast on a desert
island with one pretty girl. Though she were as unamiable as
Juno, cold and coy as Diana, in less than a month nineteen of the
twenty youths would be in love with her and bitter personal
enemies. Here the man would fall in love with the woman; the
fundamental tone of passion would prevail; whereas if there had
been a choice, eighteen of those men perhaps would never have
dreamed of proposing to that girl. Now second Love is much
more apt to be thus influenced by Individual Preference than first;
and the more Love is individualised the deeper it is. Failure to
find lasting satisfaction in the first choice makes a man more slow
and cautious in his second choice.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time the mind expands and grows, and age
strengthens not only the intellect but the emotions as well. <em>For
his size</em>, a boy may love as ardently as a man; but the man is bigger.</p>

<p class='c001'>The history of the race agrees with that of the individual in
showing that Love at first is a general passion, only slightly discriminative,
but becomes more and more so as time goes on.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even the objection urged against second Love by Goethe and
Heine appears of no special significance when brought face to face
with facts. Very few men, if any, who are in Love a second or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>third time, sit in a corner to muse over the transitoriness of passion
till they become “disgusted with life.” On the contrary, they
feel convinced that the preceding infatuation was, after all, not real
indomitable Love, such as they now experience towards Daisy
No. 2; which second infatuation they absolutely <em>know</em> is the
genuine article; just as they <em>know</em> that no one ever before loved so
deeply and devotedly. This naïve self-confidence of the lover in
the unprecedented ardour and uniqueness of his passion is one of
the most sublime <em>and</em> ridiculous aspects of Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>And here it may be said, for the benefit of timid souls who
may possibly fear that harm may result to the cause of Love from
exposing its perishableness, that the only persons who could be
injured by the destruction of this illusion—those who happen to
be in Love—will positively and absolutely refuse to believe that
<em>their</em> particular passion is fugitive. They will simply laugh in the
face of any one who questions the immortality of their Love; and
a year or two later, perhaps, they will laugh again—for a different
reason.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed, the notion that true Love never dies and will for ever
monopolise the soul, may actually do harm, and sometimes does
so. The disappointed lover commits suicide not because his
torments seem intolerable for the moment, but because he is convinced
they will last for ever, and thus make life not worth living.</p>

<p class='c001'>A review of the situation brings out the truth that the only
apparent advantage which First Love has over later passions is
Novelty. Yet even this advantage proves to be illusory; for
though the Second Love may not be a novelty, the Girl is; and
does not Moore, the modern Anakreon, sing—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Enough for me that she’s a new one”?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>One more consideration. There is an adage, not entirely unknown,
that practice makes perfect; and psychology teaches that
feelings tend to become deeper by repetition. Why should Love
be an exception? The channels worn in the brain by the first
emotions will be reopened and widened by the new flood of passion;
and thus <em>remembered emotion</em> will add its force to that of the
present moment.</p>

<p class='c001'>Has the reader ever heard Wagner’s <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Nibelung Tetralogy</cite></span>? If
so, he will remember with what a thrill of delight he recognised
in the later dramas some of the motives and melodies he had
heard in the preceding ones. In the later dramas these melodies
are appreciated not only for their own intrinsic beauty, but because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>they come laden with the sad and joyous associations and
memories of the preceding scenes which they illustrated.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wagner was not only a great musician and dramatist, he was
also a most subtle psychologist. He <em>doubled</em> the power of music
by adding to the enjoyment of the moment the strong current of
<em>remembered emotion</em>. And this is precisely what a later passion
of manhood adds to the naïve delights of First Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is remarkable how many analogies there are between Music
and Love—the youngest art and the youngest sentiment; and how
the love of the divine art enables one to understand and feel more
deeply the music of the divine passion.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>PRIDE AND VANITY</h3>

<p class='c013'>Jealousy and Monopoly are the two selfish features of Love
which urge an enamoured couple to flee society and friends, and
take refuge on a desert island. Fortunately there is in the
chemistry of Love a third selfish element—the Pride of successful
wooing, which commonly is strong enough to neutralise the antisocial
tendencies of the other two. If a lover’s passion has not
yet risen to fever-heat, nothing (except Jealousy) will so suddenly
raise it as the Pride and conceit inspired by noticing that people
in general admire his chosen girl; the more of the admirers, the
greater his Pride. And if, in addition, sympathising friends
directly approve his choice and laud her merits in detail, then his
transports of ecstasy become celestial.</p>

<p class='c001'>Inasmuch as in moments of elation over success of any kind a
man feels as if nothing were beyond his power, an accepted lover
is as proud (I suppose) as if he had conquered not only one girl,
but the whole feminine kingdom—or queendom: for surely the
one chosen by him is the cleverest and most beautiful of all;
whence it follows that all the inferior ones would of course have
been only too proud if he had condescended to pay his addresses
to them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Why do great men so often marry women who are not especially
attractive as to personal appearance, when often they might have
had their choice among a group of beauties? Because the spoiled
beauties did not understand the art of flattery, sincere or otherwise.
Every man wishes to be considered either a creative genius or a
hero. The woman who knows how to touch the sympathetic
chord, to make each one’s particular kind of Pride vibrate, has him
at her feet in an instant.</p>

<p class='c001'>In conjugal life the most ludicrous of all sights is the royal self-complacency
with which a man accepts the eager worship of his wife.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Conversely, a rejected lover’s heart bleeds from so many wounds
that it is difficult to count them; but of all these wounds the one
inflicted by the jealous thought that she will now marry another
is alone deep as that of his offended Pride. The sense of superiority
which every man feels over every other man is crushed, and
cannot be laid as a flattering unction to the soul. Hence a girl
who refuses a proposal and does not at least keep it a secret, is not
only quite as mean, but a thousand times more cruel than a man
who will “kiss and tell.”</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Coquetry.</em>—Yet of all secrets the compliment of an offer is the
hardest for a woman to keep; so, in strictest confidence, she tells
it to only one solitary person, who ditto, who ditto, who ditto, etc.
etc. etc. etc. and so on.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a class of women whose sole pleasure in life appears to
be derived from vanity gratified by offers of Love and Marriage.
Of all the elements of Love—and there are at least eleven—her
soul is affected by one alone—the overtone of Pride. The Coquette
has already been superficially examined, and distinguished from
the Flirt. But this is the place where she must be placed under
the microscope and more closely examined. A great many distinguished
observers have dissected her, and here are a few of
their discoveries.</p>

<p class='c001'>Congreve lets her off easily—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“’Tis not to wound a wanton boy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or amorous youth, that gives the joy;</div>
      <div class='line'>But ’tis the glory to have pierced the swain</div>
      <div class='line'>For whom inferior beauties sighed in vain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Fielding is less lenient: “The life of a coquette is one constant
lie.” “The coquette,” says Mr. T. B. Aldrich—"all’s one to her;
above her fan she’d make sweet eyes at Caliban." According to
Victor Hugo, “God created the coquette as soon as He had made
the fool;” and Byron asks, “What careth she for hearts when
once possessed?” When Moore wrote—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“More joy it gives to woman’s breast</div>
      <div class='line'>To make ten frigid coxcombs vain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than one true manly lover blest;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>he had evidently just left the chill atmosphere of a coquette. “A
coquette,” says A. Duprey, “is more occupied with the homage
we withhold than with that which we bestow upon her.”
“Coquettes are the quacks of love,” says Rochefoucauld. “Heartlessness
and fascination, in about equal proportions, constitute,”
according to Mme. Deluzy, “the receipt for forming the character
of a coquette.” And Poincelot caps the climax: “An asp would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>render its sting more venomous by dipping it into the heart of a
coquette.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There are masculine as well as feminine Coquettes; but there
is one striking difference between them. To the female Coquette
all is game that gets into her net; she will turn away from a man
of genius, an Apollo, already at her feet, to fascinate a rough and
freckled country lad at first sight; whereas a male Coquette rarely
wastes his powder on a girl who isn’t pretty. And even herein is
seen the superiority of man’s Love to woman’s. The male Coquette
is actuated by Admiration of Beauty as well as by Pride; the
female Coquette by Pride alone.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cannibals have a quaint old custom of eating certain parts of
a formidable enemy’s body, in the belief that they will thus inherit
his qualities,—as by eating his tongue, his eloquence; his heart,
his courage. What a delicious gastronomic morsel a Coquette’s heart
would be to these savages, whose principal amusement is cruelty!</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps the best description ever given of a Coquette is Thackeray’s
portraiture of Beatrix—"A woman who has listened to"
her admirers, “and played with them and laughed with them,—who,
beckoning them with lures and caresses, and with Yes smiling
from her eyes, has tricked them on to their knees, and turned her
back and left them.”</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Love and Rank.</em>—Not so many years ago the newspapers of a
certain European country made a great deal of ado about a forthcoming
marriage between a blue-blooded youth and a ditto maiden,
for the reason that it was “a real Love-match.” Poor princes!
so rarely are they allowed to choose their own Juliet, they who
are supposed to be the rulers of the land. Until quite recently, it
is true, public opinion on the Continent sanctioned a Love-marriage
between an aristocrat and a non-aristocrat <em>provided it was unlawful</em>,
<i>i.e.</i> morganatic, a special royal euphemy for bigamy; but now
even this privilege is abolished, and princes can marry one of equal
rank only, in pursuance of a custom more tyrannical, more restrictive
than the parental command on which marriage-unions depended
in ancient and mediæval times.</p>

<p class='c001'>German novelists have made considerable progress in their art
in recent years, but in one respect it seems to be very difficult for
them to substitute realism for romance. In every love story,
almost, one of the leading characters must be either a prince or a
princess. As if it were not the very essence of a prince and a
princess that they shall not be allowed to love and marry for Love—unless
they are clever enough to fall in Love with the partner
singled out for them, which happens once in a hundred times, perhaps.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>But it is not only in the highest circles that aristocratic Pride
is opposed to free Sexual Selection. It extends through a hundred
scales of the social ladder. Germany presents a remarkable
example. The metaphysician Eduard von Hartmann credits the
government of that country with great astuteness. Not having
much money to pay its officials, it has established a legion of distinctions
of rank and titles, for the sake of which the officials are
quite willing to forego a larger salary. Of the ludicrous conceit
inspired by this distinction of having even the slightest kind of a
“handle” to their name, I can give an amusing instance from my
own experience. Some years ago, desiring to see the Intendant,
or Manager, of the Munich Opera-house, I entered a little room,
marked Portier, and found that gentleman comfortably seated, <em>with
his cap on</em>. He took my card, on which there was no “handle”
of any sort, and replied sternly, “The Intendant is in; I will send
up your card;” adding, more severely still, “And, young man, let
me tell you, that when you come into the presence of <em>a royal official</em>,
it behoves you to remove your hat!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Harmless as such childish vanity may seem, it is yet one of the
reasons why there are fewer good-looking women in Germany than
in most European countries—France always excepted. For a girl,
whose father wears on his coat the order of the black eagle, to
marry a young man whose father only has the order of the green
eagle, would be considered an unpardonable <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>mésalliance</i></span>, and would
scandalise the whole neighbourhood. Of course it does not make
much difference in a woman’s own looks whether she marries a
man she loves or one whom she can barely tolerate, and who is
forced on her by parental desire and public opinion, but it does
make a difference with her children; and even in her own case, is
it not self-evident that the smile of pleasure at being happily married
is a better preservative of youthful beauty than the constant frown
of disappointment, perhaps of disgust?</p>

<p class='c001'>The highest treason against Cupid, however, is committed by
those American women, who, without the excuse of inherited custom,
come to Europe with their money to marry a baron. Fortunately
such marriages have almost always ended so wretchedly that the
fashion has somewhat lost its popularity. What is a baron? Perhaps
a man whose great-great-great-grandfather “lent” some duke
or king a few thousand gold pieces, in return for which he was allowed
to place “von” or “de” before his name. And on the strength
of this little word the family Pride has gone on steadily increasing
through various generations—or rather, degenerations.</p>

<p class='c001'>Physiology is not usually considered an ironic science, but it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>cannot help writing a satire when it teaches that “blue” blood is
venous blood, charged with the waste products of the bodily tissues.
How much better than this irony would iron be, <i>i.e.</i> some fresh,
<em>red</em>, arterial blood infused in the bodies of the Continental aristocracy.
The English aristocracy, on the other hand, presents one
of the finest types of manhood and womanhood; and the reason is
suggested by Darwin: “Many persons are convinced, as appears
to me with justice, that our aristocracy, including under this term
all wealthy families in which primogeniture has long prevailed, from
having chosen during many generations <em>from all classes</em> the more
beautiful women as their wives, have become handsomer, according
to the European standard, than the middle classes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Vivid as the feeling of pride must be in a man of humble origin
who has succeeded in winning the Love of a woman of a higher
social grade; and greatly as a Coquette must be tickled in counting
off the number of hearts offered to her, on her fingers if she has
enough to go round: yet the climax of Lover’s Pride, it seems to
me, must be reached by a man of noble birth who, scorning
mediæval puerilities, marries the girl who has won his heart, and
were she but a plump, rosy-cheeked peasant girl. This vivid feeling
was doubtless realised by the Grand Duke of Austria when he
married Philippine Welser, by the Duke of Bavaria when he
married Maria Pettenbeck.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>SPECIAL SYMPATHY</h3>

<p class='c013'>Thanks to the social instinct, our pains are halved, our pleasures
doubled, if we can share them with others. The proverb that
misery loves company expresses only half the truth; happiness,
too, loves company. The late King of Bavaria used to enjoy an
opera most if he was the sole spectator in the house; but most
persons would lose half their pleasure in this way. Nor is this a
purely imaginary feeling; for in a successful performance there are
moments when the intensely-silent and universal absorption seems
to raise a magnetic wave, which crosses the house and makes all
nerves vibrate and thrill in unison. Again, if a man whom constant
attendance at places of amusement has rendered <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>blasé</i></span>, happens to
sit next to a young girl who visits the theatre for the first time,
the emotional play of her features, by reviving the memory of his
first experiences, enables him to share her feelings sympathetically,
and thus to enjoy the performance doubly. And is it not a universal
experience that if we witness sublime or beautiful scenes—if
we approach the Niagara Falls in a small boat from below, or if,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>standing on the top of the Breithorn near Zermatt, we see almost
the whole of Switzerland and the Tyrol, parts of France and Italy,
down to Lago Maggiore, at the same moment—almost our first
thought is, “Oh, if So-and-so could only see me now and share
this wondrous sight with me!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor is this instinctive craving for Sympathy absent in the mind
of the poet who <em>prefers</em> to be alone with Nature; on the contrary,
it is even deeper in his case. For to him Nature is personal; he</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sermons in stones;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>nor does Nature refuse her sympathy; for does she not harmonise
with all his moods, looking gloomy if he is sad, bright if he is
cheerful?</p>

<p class='c001'>From these general manifestations of emotional partnership
Lover’s Sympathy differs in being omnipresent and more exclusively
concentrated on one person. There is an association of emotions
as well as of ideas: and as every idea of excellence recalls <em>her</em>
Perfection, so every emotion inspired by a beautiful object calls up
the image of <em>the</em> Beauty <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>par excellence</i></span>. Thus Love gets the benefit
of all these associated emotions—waggon-loads of kindling wood.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>How Love intensifies Emotions.</em>—But is it literally true that
in Love, as Mr. Spencer puts it, “purely personal pleasures are
doubled by being shared with another?” It is true; though the
way in which this is done is difficult to explain. No psychologist,
so far as I am aware, has cracked the nut. I have given considerable
thought to the subject, and venture to offer the following
three suggestions as to the method by which Love doubles our
pleasures:—</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) The lover’s pleasures are increased by the simple process of
<em>emotional addition</em>. That is, supposing him to be reading a poem
or story to his beloved, he will experience at one and the same
moment not only the emotions inspired by the poem or novel he is
reading, but those due to the sense of her presence. As the mind
does not stop to analyse its feelings at such moments, all these
various pleasurable emotions will coalesce into one seemingly
homogeneous feeling of happiness; just as two complementary
colours, or all the colours of the rainbow, if mixed, will produce
the simple sensation called white.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) The second way in which sympathetic companionship intensifies
a lover’s feelings is through what may be called <em>emotional
resonance</em>. If you take a violin-string in your hands, stretch it
tightly, and then get some one to pluck it, a very faint sound only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>will be heard. But put it in its proper place, over the resonant
surface of the instrument, and it will produce a full, loud, mellow
tone. A human countenance is such an instrument—a sort of
emotional sounding-board. Every man feels more or less pleased
with himself if he gets off at table what he considers a wise or
witty remark. If the sounding-boards of his neighbours vibrate
responsively to his jokes, he feels proud and is doubly pleased; but
if they only grin politely, the tone of his self-satisfaction is immediately
lowered an octave and dies away pianissimo. Now between
lovers such a fiasco is absolutely impossible. <em>They</em> never grin at
one another’s sayings for the sake of politeness merely. His
most platitudinous remarks are sure to start a symphony of smiles
on her countenance, where another man’s wittiest epigrams would
be barely rewarded with a slight curl of the lips; and as for him,
she may say anything she pleases, he never knows what she says
but hears only the music of her voice—as if her words were the
text, the rising and falling of her voice the melody, of an Italian
opera. No wonder lovers are so exclusively interesting to each
other, and such unmitigated bores to other people.</p>

<p class='c001'>Unfortunately lovers’ sympathy is rarely complete or durable.
Sooner or later some difference of taste or opinion is discovered
which has the same effect as a crack in the sounding-board—the
resonance is destroyed. Yet it can be restored by using glue; and
violin-builders will tell you that a glued instrument is often better
than one which has never had a crack.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) Thirdly, Love intensifies human feelings by producing a
state of <em>emotional hyperæsthesia</em>, or supersensitiveness, which has
the effect of a microphone in multiplying the loudness of every
impression. Music teachers whose acoustic nerves are rendered
excessively irritable by overwork; students whose eyes, from
reading late at night, are in the same condition, are annoyed by
sights and sounds which ordinary mortals barely notice. But
Love with its sleepless night daily fevers, and prolonged fastings
is more potent than any other cause in producing such a state of
extreme sensitiveness to every impression. Lovers’ souls may
therefore be aptly compared to Æolian harps. If you leave the
strings of such an instrument in a state of very loose tension, they
resemble the souls of ordinary mortals not in Love: for it takes
a very strong breeze to elicit any sound from them. But raise
them to a higher state of tension, like the souls of lovers, and the
faintest breath of air will cause them to sound in sympathetic
unison all their harmonics—which is another name for <em>overtones</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Development of Sympathy.</em>—Not only does Love thus owe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>much of its unique intenseness to Sympathy, but there are weighty
reasons for believing that Love has already played an important
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span>, and is destined to play a still more important one, in
modifying the meaning of Sympathy and in extending its influence
to society in general.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the absence of true Romantic Love among savages was
being pointed out more emphasis should have been placed on the
fact that they seem to be utter strangers to sympathy. Far from
sharing another’s delights and sorrows, a savage takes an intense
delight in witnessing a man enduring the agonies of deliberate
torture. Cruelty seems to give him the same thrill of joy that
sympathetic assistance gives to a refined person.</p>

<p class='c001'>How are we to account for this strange delight in another’s
sufferings? By noting the extreme coarseness and callousness of
the primitive man’s nerves. Just as some savages are known to
have such hardened hides and lungs that they can sleep naked in
a snowstorm with impunity, where a white man would be sure to
perish of cold or subsequent pneumonia; so the savage requires
the coarsest of stimulants to make any impression on his sluggish
emotions. The sight of an enemy tied to a tree and being flayed
alive tickles his nerves by suggesting his own comfortable freedom
in comparison, and by showing him an enemy absolutely in his
power; while his imagination is not sufficiently vivid to enable
him to put himself in the other’s place to feel his contortions and
suppressed moans re-echoing in his own soul.</p>

<p class='c001'>And have we not in our very midst thousands of so-called
civilised beings who require stimulants almost as coarse as the
savage to amuse their dull imaginations?—people who would
hesitate to pay silver for a book, a concert, or an art exhibition,
but gladly give gold to witness the execution of a criminal or an
exhibition of animals torturing one another to death. To suppose
that such people can ever fall in Love—Romantic Love—is more
than absurd.</p>

<p class='c001'>Children represent this savage stage of the evolution of
sympathy; as their imagination, like all their mental powers, is
still in embryo. Nothing delights the average boy so much as a
chance to torture a beetle, a cat, or a dog. And Mr. Galton
somewhere refers to the sense of blood-curdling produced on him
and other sensitive persons in the London Zoological Gardens at
the sight of snakes devouring living animals. “Yet,” he adds,
“I have often seen people—nurses, for instance, and children of
all ages—looking unconcernedly and amusedly at the scene.”</p>

<p class='c001'>To substitute Sympathy for this delight in torture—to arouse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>the sluggish imagination from its thousand years’ sleep, and
quicken its sense of suffering in man and animals—is one of the
greatest problems of moral culture, and—so far as man is
concerned—forms one of the keynotes of Christianity. St. Paul
bids us both to bear one another’s burdens and to rejoice with
one another. The second part of his injunction, however, has
been comparatively neglected, as is best shown by the circumstance
that we have several terms to express the sharing of sorrow
(compassion, pity, sympathy), whereas for the sharing of joy there
is no special noun in the English language. The Germans have a
word for it—<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Mitfreude</i></span>—yet it rarely occurs out of philosophical
treatises. The word Sympathy, which literally means “suffering
with,” has also been most commonly used in that sense. But it
is now frequently being used in the sense of sharing joy too, and
perhaps, despite its etymology, it will, for lack of another word,
be chiefly used in this sense in future. Even at present, when
persons are spoken of as sympathetic or antipathetic, much less
regard is paid to their willingness to bear our burdens or share
our sorrows than to the chances of their sharing in our pleasures
by having similar tastes and opinions.</p>

<p class='c001'>For this change in the meaning of Sympathy, Romantic Love
must, I believe, be held chiefly responsible. To some extent, no
doubt, friends and relatives shared one another’s joys before the
advent of Love. Yet even the mother—taking the most favourable
case—cannot enter into all her child’s feelings, while to the
child most of her mature emotions are utterly incomprehensible;
so that we miss here that reciprocation which is the very essence
of Sympathy; whereas a lover cannot even conceive a pleasure
unless the other shares it—another point in the psychology of
Modern Love to which Shakspere has given the most poetic
expression—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Except I be by Sylvia in the night,</div>
      <div class='line'>There is no music in the nightingale.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Thus we see that there are three stages in the evolution of
Sympathy: the first, in which cruelty neutralises it; the second,
in which this universal enjoyment of cruelty, with its attendant
lack of imagination and altruistic feeling, compelled moralists to
lay more stress on the virtue of compassion than on the refining
pleasures of mutual enjoyment; the third, the epoch of Romantic
Love, in which the positive side of the emotional partnership is
specially emphasised, so that a lover cannot pour forth a song of
happiness except in the form of a duo.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>And this brings us back again to a question left unanswered
in the section on Jealousy. A rejected lover’s deepest anguish is
the thought that “She will now be happy in another’s arms.”
To hear that she has entered a convent and will never enjoy the
pleasures of Love denied him would be his only consolation. Is
this an aberration of Sympathy, or does it mark its climax—its
remorseless logical consistency? The answer lies in the second
suggestion. Were Love an altruistic passion, it would be otherwise.
<em>He</em> would delight in <em>her</em> happiness under all circumstances.
But Love is selfish—a double selfishness; and its sense of justice
demands that each side be considered. “If I cannot be happy
without her, how can she without me?” The lover does not
consider that the passion is one-sided—he cannot fathom that
mystery—cannot understand why his flame, which reduces him to
ashes, is not strong enough to set her on fire, and were she a
stone image.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Pity and Love.</em>—According to Darwin, one of the chief mental
differences between man and woman is woman’s greater tenderness.
Of this feminine tenderness the world has been able to
judge on a vast scale during the last two or three years.</p>

<p class='c001'>According to a statement in <cite>Nature</cite>, 30,000 ruby and topaz
humming-birds were sold in London some years ago in the course
of one afternoon, “and the number of West Indian and Brazilian
birds sold by one auction-room in London during the four months
ending April 1885, was 404,464, besides 356,389 Indian birds,
without counting thousands of Impeyan pheasants, birds of
paradise,” etc. A writer in <cite>Forest and Stream</cite> mentioned a
dealer in South Carolina who handled 30,000 bird-skins per
annum. “During four months 70,000 birds were supplied to
New York dealers from a single village on Long Island, and an
enterprising woman from New York contracted with a Paris
millinery firm to deliver during this summer 40,000 or more skins
of birds at 40 cents a piece. From Cape Cod, one of the haunts
of terns and gulls, 40,000 of the former birds were killed in a
single season, so that at points where a few years since these
beautiful birds filled the air with their graceful forms and snowy
plumage, only a few pairs now remain.” “It is estimated that
not less than 5,000,000 birds of all sorts were killed last year for
purposes of ornamentation,” wrote Mr. E. P. Powell in the New
York <cite>Independent</cite>. A correspondent of the New York <cite>Evening
Post</cite> saw at an art exhibition a young lady, with “nothing in her
face to denote excessive cruelty,” who wore a hat trimmed with
“the heads of <em>over twenty little birds</em>”; and the same paper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>remarked editorially: “No one can tell how large a bird can be
worn on a woman’s head, by walking in Fifth Avenue. It is
necessary to take a ride in a Second Avenue car to get the full
effect of the prevailing fashion. There one may see on the head-gear
of poorer classes, and especially of coloured women, every
species of the feathered kingdom smaller than a prairie chicken or
a canvas-back duck and every colour of the rainbow.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Think of women!” exclaims Diderot; “they are miles
beyond us in sensibility.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was <cite>Science</cite>, edited by men, that started the agitation
against woman’s cruel and tasteless fashion—a fashion which not
one woman in a hundred apparently refused to conform to. It
was Messrs. J. A. Allen, W. Dutcher, G. B. Sennett, and other
ornithologists, who raised their voices in behalf of the murdered
birds, for whom no woman seemed to have a thought except Mrs.
Celia Thaxter—all honour to her—and a small circle of ladies in
England. It was Oliver Wendell Holmes who wrote how he felt
“the shame of the wanton destruction of our singing-birds to feed
the demands of a barbaric vanity;” another man, Charles Dudley
Warner, who pertinently suggested that “a dead bird does not
help the appearance of an ugly woman, and a pretty woman needs
no such adornment.”</p>

<p class='c001'>That the average woman’s imagination is not sufficiently refined
and quick to feel for these winged poems of the air is historically
proven by this fashion, which, characteristically enough, was first
introduced by a member of the Paris <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>demi-monde</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has disappeared for the moment, but is almost absolutely
certain to reappear within five years.</p>

<p class='c001'>But who, after all, is responsible for this sluggish condition of
the feminine imagination, this lack of sympathy for the fate of
harmless happy birds, who in their domestic affections and love-affairs
so closely resemble man? Is it not the men who, till
within a few years, have refused to give their daughters a rational
education? It must be so, for in that sphere where woman has
been able to educate herself, and where she is queen—in the
domestic circle, she <em>does</em> possess that tender sympathy which she
withholds from lower beings.</p>

<p class='c001'>Within the range of human affections woman manifests more
pity, is stirred to nobler needs of self-sacrifice, than man. Is
Love included in this category? Dryden tells us that “pity
melts the heart to love,” and novelists delight to make their
heroines first refuse their suitors and subsequently accept them
from real Love born of pity. For my part, I doubt this assumed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>relationship between Pity and Love; and I do not believe that a
girl who has refused a lover ordinarily feels any more pity for him
than a cat does for a mouse, or a person who is all right on a
steamer does for another who is sea-sick—though he be his best
friend. There is an instinctive belief in the human mind that
love-sickness and sea-sickness are never fatal.</p>

<p class='c001'>It does, indeed, very often happen—perhaps in half the cases;
it would be interesting to have approximate statistics on the
subject—that a girl first refuses the man whose second or third
offer she accepts; for, as an anonymous writer remarks, “women
are so made (happily for men) that gratitude, pity, the exquisite
pleasure of pleasing, the sweet surprise at finding themselves
necessary to another’s happiness ... altogether obscure and confuse
the judgment.” But in such cases there are other factors
which probably influence the girl much more than Pity does.
She is, in the first place, largely influenced by this “exquisite
pleasure of pleasing”—another name for Pride. Then there is a
certain advantage to a man in having proposed, even unsuccessfully;
for whenever subsequently the girl reads about Love she
will involuntarily think of him; and thus his image will become
associated with all the pleasure she derives from Love stories—which
may prove the first step for her—and a long one—into the
romantic passion. Besides, to propose to a girl is the greatest
compliment a man can pay a girl; and this cannot be without
influence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus it is possible that Pity, allied with Pride, association, and
flattery, may work a change of feeling in a feminine mind; but
Pity alone will rarely lead her into the realms of Cupid. A man
certainly would never dream of marrying from Pity, on seeing that
she loves him deeply, a woman for whom he does not otherwise
care. Nor should either man or woman ever marry from Pity,
any more than for money or rank. Love should ever be the sole
guide to matrimony.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Love at First Sight.</em>—La Bruyère gives his opinion that “the
love which arises suddenly takes longest to cure;” and that
“love which grows slowly and by degrees resembles friendship too
much to be an ardent passion.” Schopenhauer, too, asserts that
“great passions, as a rule, arise at first sight.” He refers to
Shakspere’s</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Who ever lov’d that lov’d not at first sight?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>and then cites Mateo Aleman’s old Spanish romance, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>Guzman de
Alfarache</cite></span>, in which, three centuries ago, the following observation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>was made: “To fall in love one does not require much time or
reflection and choice; all that is needed is that in that first and
only sight there should be a mutual suitability and harmony, or
what in common life we call a sympathy of the blood, and which
is due to a special influence of the stars.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As it is not permissible, in these degenerate days of positive
science, to explain a thing by a vague reference to poetic astrology,
an attempt must be made to account for the possibility of Love at
first sight on more prosaic grounds.</p>

<p class='c001'>Physiognomy furnishes a simple solution of the problem. In
every man’s face is painted his personal history, as well as his
favourite and customary sphere of thoughts and feelings. As Sir
Charles Bell remarks, “Expression is to passion what language is
to thought.” The gift of reading correctly this facial language of
passion is given to different persons in different degrees, though
all have some share of it: and on their more or less accurate
and subtle interpretation of the “lines and frowns and wrinkles
strange” in another’s features depends the art of reading character
and being sympathetically attracted or repulsed, as the case may
be. A young man who has unconsciously associated certain peculiarities
of facial expression in his sisters or female friends with
habitual cheerfulness, amiability, and brightness will, on recognising
similar features in a new acquaintance, take for granted
similar charms of character: this, which is the work of a second,
may result in sympathy at first sight, which very often is the
beginning of Romantic Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>Love at First Sight may be inspired by this instinctive perception
of beauty of character, <i>i.e.</i> amiability; or by the sight of
mere physical beauty; or, thirdly, by Personal Beauty in the
highest sense of the word, uniting intellectual fascination with
bodily charms.</p>

<p class='c001'>Inasmuch as there are not a few men whose æsthetic taste is
so weak that they would rather marry a useful, companionable
girl and imagine her beautiful, than take a beauty and imagine
her useful; and inasmuch as there are a great many more amiable
and vivacious girls in the world than pretty ones, it happens that
in a large number of cases Love is inspired by the physiognomic
interpretation of sympathetic traits of character just referred to.
Hence plain girls need never despair of finding husbands. There
is even a current notion that the deepest passions are commonly
inspired by plain women who are otherwise attractive. But what
inspires the Love in these cases is not so much the woman’s
amiability—and certainly not her plainness—as the fact that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>style of her homeliness is of an opposite kind from the faults of
the lover, and promises to neutralise them in the offspring.</p>

<p class='c001'>Plain and homely, moreover, are terms often applied to women
whose faces only are so, while their figures are sometimes superb.
But a fine figure is quite as essential a part of Personal Beauty as
a fine face, and is, in the opinion of Schopenhauer, even more
potent as a love-inspirer. If the figure is disregarded in favour of
the face, Romantic Love is apt to become hyper-romantic, as in
the days of Dante.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps the largest number of cases of Love at First Sight, so
called, are inspired by mere <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>beauté du diable</i></span>—a female “bud”
whose sole charm apparent is sparkling health and fragrant,
dew-bejewelled freshness. That this kind of Love at sight,
which consists in being dazzled for the moment by a set of
regular features and a pair of bright eyes, is often of brief duration,
does not militate against the statement that the deepest
Love is also born of such a flash of æsthetic admiration. An
incipient passion may be crushed by the discovery of some disagreeable
trait in the person who inspired it; but when, owing
to want of early opportunity to discover unsympathetic traits,
Love has been allowed to make some progress, the subsequent
discovery of a flaw is not nearly so serious a matter, for then
Master Cupid simply puts a daub of whitewash on it and calls it
a beauty-spot.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Intellect and Love.</em>—But, after all, the deepest Love at Sight,
and that which gives promise of greatest permanence, is that
inspired by a handsome woman in whose face Intellect has written
its autograph. Goethe, indeed, has remarked that “intellect
cannot warm us, or inspire us with passion;” but the view he
takes here of the relations between intellect and passion is obviously
very crude and superficial. No man, of course, would ever
fall in Love with a woman who showed her intellectuality—as not
a few do—by a parrotlike repetition of encyclopædic reading or
magazine epitomes of knowledge. This gives evidence of only
one form of intellect, the lowest, namely, Memory. It is the
higher forms—imagination, wit, clever reasoning, that constitute
the essence of intellectual culture; and though woman may never
quite equal man in this sphere, such cases as Mme. de Staël,
George Sand, and George Eliot show how much she <em>can</em> accomplish
by means of application.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now this higher kind of intellectual culture is able to influence
the amorous feelings in two ways: first, by refining and vivifying
the features; secondly, by enabling a woman to appreciate her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>lover’s ambitions and afford him sympathetic assistance, thereby
awakening a responsive echo in his grateful mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>Look at Miss Marbleface in yonder corner, surrounded by a
group of admirers. Everybody wonders why she, whose features
might inspire a sculptor, remains unmarried at twenty-six. Her
friends, indeed, whisper that she never even got an offer. Yet all
the men to whom she is introduced admire her immensely—the
first evening; but strange to say, after they have seen her a few
times, they are not a bit jealous to leave her to a new group of
admirers; who, in turn, cede her to another. Her beauty, in
truth, is but skin-deep, <em>literally</em>; the muscles under the skin are
never vivified by an electric flash of wit from the brain; there is
nothing but marble features and a stereotyped smile; no animation,
no change of expression, no Intellect. Were her intellect as
carefully cultivated as her features are chiselled, she would inspire
<em>Love</em>, not mere momentary admiration; and she would have been
married six years ago to a man chosen at will from the whole
circle of her acquaintances.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is easy to explain how the absurd and fatal notion that intellectual
application mars women’s peculiar beauty and lessens the
feminine graces in general must have arisen. The inference seems
to follow logically from the two undeniable premises that pretty
girls very often <em>are</em> insipid, and intellectual women commonly <em>are</em>
plain. But this is only another case of putting the cart before the
horse. Pretty girls, on the one hand, are so rare that they are
almost sure to be spoiled by flattery. They receive so much attention
that they have no time for study; and ambitious mothers
take them into society prematurely, where they get married before
their intellectual capacities—which sometimes are excellent—have
had time to unfold. Ugly girls, on the other hand, being
neglected by the men, have to while away their time with books,
music, art, etc., and thus they become bright and entertaining.
Therefore it is not the intellect that makes them ugly, but the
ugliness that makes them intellectual.</p>

<p class='c001'>The culture that can be compressed into a single lifetime unfortunately
does not suffice to modify the bony and cartilaginous
parts of the human face sufficiently to change homeliness into
beauty; but the muscles can be mobilised, the expression quickened
and beautified by an individual’s efforts at culture; hence some of
these reputed plain intellectual women, in moments when they are
excited, become more truly fascinating, with all their badly-chiselled
features, than any number of cold marble faces. If men only knew
it!—but they are afraid of them—the average men are—because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>they do not constantly wish to be reminded of their own mental
shortcomings in a tournament of wit, pleasantry, or erudition.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even Schopenhauer, who was convinced that women are too
stupid to appreciate a man’s intellect, if abnormal, held that
women, on the contrary, gain an advantage in Love by cultivating
their minds; adding that it is owing to the appreciation of this
fact that mothers teach their daughters music, languages, etc.;
thus artificially padding out their minds, as on occasion they do
parts of the body.</p>

<p class='c001'>No doubt, as a rule, women are more influenced in love-affairs
by a man who excels in athletic qualities of manly energy than by
one of intellectual supereminence. But the adoration of women
for a Liszt, a Rubinstein, and other men of genius, whose eminence
lies in a department that has been made accessible to women for
centuries, shows what might be if women were trained in other
spheres of human activity and knowledge.</p>

<p class='c001'>Regarding the mental padding, however, we might continue in
the old pessimist’s vein by saying that it is a trick which has had
its day. Men do not marry girls quite so blindly as in the days
when Romantic Love was a novelty. They keep their eyes open;
and when they find that their girl’s musical “culture” consists in
the mechanical drumming of three pieces, and that her other
“accomplishments” are similar shams, they are apt to take their
throbbing hearts and put them into a refrigerator until the young
lady has become a faded, harmless old maid, still drumming her
three pieces on the piano. The fact that so many mothers persist
in thus “padding” their daughters’ minds, instead of educating
them properly, is largely responsible for the ever-increasing number
of self-conscious and disgusted bachelors in the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>The example of Aspasia illustrates both the physical advantages
beauty derives from intellectual culture—through the refinement
of expression—and the emotional advantages a woman secures by
being able to sympathise intelligently with her lover’s or husband’s
enterprises. Nothing more irresistibly fascinates a man than
genuine questioning interest shown by a woman in his life-work.
Or, as Mr. Hamerton puts it, “the most exquisite pleasure the
masculine mind can ever know, is that of being looked upon by a
feminine intelligence with clear sight and affection at the same
time.” But on this topic Mr. Mill has discoursed so enthusiastically
in his <cite>Subjection of Women</cite> that anything that might be
added here could be little more than a faint echo of his persuasive
eloquence, tinged though it be with true lovers’ exaggeration.</p>

<p class='c001'>Goethe illustrated his maxim that “intellect cannot warm us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>or inspire us with passion” by marrying a pretty, brainless doll of
whom he soon got heartily tired. Heine followed his example by
marrying a Parisian labouring girl who, like Madame Racine, probably
never read her husband’s writings. And in his <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Unterwelt</cite></span> he
laments his <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“verfehlte Liebe, verfehltes Leben”</span>—his mistaken
love and wasted life.</p>

<p class='c001'>Why did the ancient Greeks neglect their women? Why did
they remain strangers to Love and seek refuge in Friendship?
Their women were modest, domestic, good mothers and wives; but
they lacked one thing, and that was Intellect.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>GALLANTRY AND SELF-SACRIFICE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Primitive tribes have a delightfully simple way of arranging
their division of labour. The men do the hunting and carry on
wars, the women do everything else. If a warrior on “moving
day” should say to his wife and daughters: “See here, this will
never do for me to have nothing but my weapons and my pipe,
while you carry the babies, the cooking utensils, the remnants of
the game, and the tent: let me help you!”—if he should say this,
his comrades would consider him crazy, or rather, possessed of a
demon, and would burn two or three persons at the stake for
having bewitched him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Gallantry, in other words, is unknown to savages either between
lovers, or, in a general sense, towards all women. Nor is it known
to semi-civilised peoples. Among the nomadic Arab tribes of the
Sahara the wife has to do all the work unless her husband is rich
enough to own a slave; and among the poorer Bedouins the husband
traverses the desert comfortably seated on his camel, while
his wife plods along behind on foot, loaded with her bed, her
kitchen utensils, and her child on top.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ancient Greeks were not so ungallant as these peoples
towards their women, as they had slaves to do their hard work;
but the constant devoted attention and desire to please which constitute
modern Gallantry did not, as we have seen, exist among
them. Among the Romans we find traces—but traces only—of
this virtue. Mediæval Gallantry reached its extremes in the
witches’ fires on the one side, and the grotesque performances of
the knight-errants on the other. The intermediate ground apparently
remained uncultivated, except during the brief period of
chivalrous poetry, and then only in the highest classes. Wherever,
in short, Romantic Love was absent, Gallantry, as one of its
ingredients, was unknown.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>Coming to modern times, we see the same parallelism between
general Gallantry and the freedom granted to the young to form
Love-matches.</p>

<p class='c001'>In France, Germany, Italy, the women still have to do the
hardest field work, though the men assist. The French, indeed,
who systematically suppress Romantic Love, are apparently the
most gallant nation in the world. But there is a general agreement
among tourists that in <em>real</em> Gallantry, which calls for self-sacrificing
actions and not mere polite words and bows, the French
are inferior to all other European nations. It is in England and
America that true general Gallantry, like true Romantic Love,
flourishes most. In America, indeed, owing to the former scarcity
of women, Gallantry was for a time carried to a ludicrous excess,
almost reminding one of the days of Don Quixote; as in that story
of the Western miners who surrounded an emigrant’s waggon and
insisted on his “trotting out” his wife; which being done by the
trembling man, who feared the worst, the “roughs” passed round
the hat and collected a large sum of gold for the woman. Perhaps
American women still are, as we read in <cite>Daisy Miller</cite>, “the most
exacting in the world and the least endowed with a sense of
indebtedness.” But the constant sight in New York and elsewhere
of street-cars in which every man has a seat while every
woman is standing, seems to indicate that there is a reaction
which may go to the opposite extreme. But after a while the
pendulum will doubtless swing back to the middle and remain
stationary; and this will be in the new golden age when men
will always give up their seats to old and infirm women, to pretty
girls, and to all the others who display truly refined instincts
and good taste by abjuring crinolines, bustles, high heels, stuffed
birds on their hats, and other “ornaments” fatal to Personal
Beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the facts thus hastily sketched we may safely infer that,
as we saw in the case of Sympathy with another’s joys, so again
with Gallantry, what was born as a trait of Romantic Love was
subsequently transferred to the social and domestic relations
of men and women in general. Had Romantic Love done nothing
more than this, it would deserve to rank among the most refining
influences in modern civilisation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps the most remarkable existing illustration of the way in
which Lovers’ Gallantry may assume a general form, is to be found
in Mr. Ruskin’s recent confession regarding girls: “My primary
thought is how to serve <em>them</em> and make them happy; or if they
could use me for a plank-bridge over a stream, or set me up for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>post to tie a swing to, or anything of the sort not requiring me to
talk, I should be always quite happy in such a promotion.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This reads precisely like Heine’s poem in which the lover wishes
he were his mistress’s footstool, or again her needle-cushion, that
he might experience the delights of pain inflicted by her foot or
hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such excess of amorous Gallantry is a favourite theme for
poetic hyperbole, and it hardly can be exaggerated; for the lover
really <em>does</em> entertain such wishes. With him, <em>romance is realism</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>No slave could be so meek and humble, no well-trained dog so
obedient as the amorous swain. Again and again will he, without
a moment’s hesitation, plunge into a wintry stream and triumphantly
snap up and bring back to her the chip she has thrown in to amuse
herself.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Active and Passive Desire to Please.</em>—"Love, studious how to
please" (Dryden), has two ways of accomplishing its purpose—one
passive, one active. Women, owing to their prescribed Coyness,
are not allowed to indulge in actions that would imply a desire to
please a suitor, except in the later stages of Courtship, when all is
settled or understood. Hence their desire to please can only show
itself passively in their efforts to make their personal appearance
attractive to the lover. Nor are men indifferent to this passive
phase of Gallantry. As nothing so fills a man with Pride as the
thought that She, a paragon of beauty, adorns herself so carefully
all for his delight; so in turn he feels it incumbent on him to
follow her example. Even the habitually slovenly become dandies
for the moment, brush their hair, buy a new hat and clothes; the
lazy become industrious, the cowards assume heroic airs and strut
about like tragedians—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>“I was the laziest creature,</div>
      <div class='line'>The most unprofitable sign of nothing,</div>
      <div class='line'>The veriest drone, and slept away my life</div>
      <div class='line'>Beyond the dormouse, till I was in love!</div>
      <div class='line'>And now I can outwake the nightingale,</div>
      <div class='line'>Outwatch an usurer, and out-walk him too,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stalk like a ghost that haunted ’bout a treasure,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all that fancied treasure, it is love.”—<span class='sc'>Ben Jonson.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Active Gallantry has been sufficiently characterised in the foregoing
pages. It is that form of the Desire to Please which readily
merges into Self-Sacrifice. A man who would never dream of
exposing himself to the slightest danger in his own behalf will, if
his sweetheart expresses admiration of a flower growing near a
dangerous precipice, rush to pluck it with an audacity which may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>cost him his life. A fatal case of this sort occurred not long ago on
the Hudson River near New York. A man’s life thrown away for
the slight æsthetic gratification to be derived by his love from the
sight and fragrance of a flower!</p>

<p class='c001'>How frequently, again, do lovers sacrifice their family bonds,
the love of parents and relatives, as well as rank and fortune, for
the sake of the romantic passion!</p>

<p class='c001'>A mother willingly dies in defence of her offspring’s life. But
will she, like Romeo, drink the apothecary’s poisonous draught over
the corpse of her dead darling? No, herein again Romantic Love
is the deepest of the passions.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Feminine Devotion.</em>—Self-Sacrifice is one of the traits of
Romantic Love which may remain unaltered and unweakened in
conjugal affection. “Those who have traced the course of the
wives of the poor,” says Mr. Lecky, “and of many who, though in
narrowed circumstances, can hardly be called poor, will probably
admit that in no other class do we so often find entire lives spent
in daily persistent self-denial, in the patient endurance of countless
trials, in the ceaseless and deliberate sacrifice of their own enjoyments
to the wellbeing or the prospects of others.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is in Wagner’s music-dramas that the modern ideal of feminine
devotion unto death has found its most stirring embodiment.
Elizabeth, having lost her Tannhäuser, thanks to the allurements
of Venus, dies of a broken heart; Senta, realising that only by her
self-sacrifice can the unhappy Dutchman be released from his terrible
doom of eternally sailing the stormy seas until he should find
a woman faithful to him unto death, tears herself away from her
family and plunges into the ocean. Isolde sings her death-song
over the body of Tristan; and Brünnhilde immolates herself on
Siegfried’s funeral pyre. Wagner’s theory of the music-drama was
a theory of Love in which each lover sacrifices selfish idiosyncrasies
in order to produce a happy union in marriage.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Mill, forgetting the difference between masculine maltreatment
of women, and voluntary female self-denial, thought it
expedient to sneer at the exaggerated self-abnegation which is the
present artificial ideal of feminine character; and those unsexed
viragoes who wish to “reform” women by robbing them of all
womanly attributes and converting them into caricatures of masculinity,
re-echo Mill’s sneer in shrill chorus. Women, they shout,
must no longer waste their best years in staying at home, educating
their children and taking care of their husbands. These brutes
have been caressed and fondled long enough; the time has come
for women to be manly and independent. Let them take away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>from men the employments, of which even now there are not
enough for three-fourths of the men; let them thus drive another
20 per cent of men and women into celibacy because the men
cannot afford any longer to marry. Let the women strip off their
artificial air of domestic refinement by mingling with the foul-mouthed,
tobacco-reeking crowds and making political stump
speeches; or by visiting the loathsome criminals in prisons, treating
them to cakes and flowers and other methods of feminine reform,
so that when set free they may be eager to do something which
will bring them back to their cakes and flowers! The children
meanwhile being left at home in charge of coarse, ignorant, careless
servants, copying their manners, and the husband compelled to
seek companionship at the club, or much worse.</p>

<p class='c001'>How the selfish husband will wince under this cold neglect and
retaliation—he who never does anything but amuse himself while
his wife toils at home; who never risks his life in war for his wife
and children; who never toils at his desk from morn to night, to
earn the daily bread of all by the sweat of his brow; who never
goes to lunatic asylums from overwork and worry! How sly in
man to set up his “artificial ideal of woman’s self-abnegation,”
while he is having such a good time! But why try to paint in
weak prose the hideousness of man’s selfish conduct, when
Shakspere has done it in immortal verse?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>And for thy maintenance commits his body</div>
      <div class='line'>To painful labour both by sea and land,</div>
      <div class='line'>To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;</div>
      <div class='line'>And craves no other tribute at thy hands</div>
      <div class='line'>But love, fair looks and true obedience;</div>
      <div class='line'>Too little payment for so great a debt.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There is another very curious aspect of Self-Sacrifice which will
be fully discussed in the chapter on Schopenhauer’s Theory of Love,
but which may be stated here, without comment, that the reader
may reflect on the pessimist’s paradox. Schopenhauer held that
Love is based on the possession by the lovers of traits which
mutually complement each other. In the children these incongruous
traits will so neutralise each other as to produce a harmonious
result; but in the life of the parents they will produce
only discords. True love, therefore, as he claims, rarely results in
a happy conjugal life: Love causes the parents to sacrifice their
mutual happiness to the welfare of their offspring.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Meanwhile it may be stated that France offers a curious
confirmation of Schopenhauer’s theory, not noted by himself.
Romantic Love, it is well known, hardly exists in France <em>as a
motive to marriage</em>, being systematically suppressed and craftily
annihilated. Nevertheless, as many observers attest, the French
commonly lead a happy family life. But look at the offspring,
at the birth-rate, the lowest in Europe; look at the puny men,
at the women, among whom there is hardly a single beauty
in all the land. In a word, whereas Love sacrifices, according to
Schopenhauer, the parents to the children, the French sacrifice the
offspring, and Love itself, to the happiness of the individuals,
married according to motives of personal expediency.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>EMOTIONAL HYPERBOLE</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers</div>
      <div class='line'>Could not, with all their quantity of love,</div>
      <div class='line'>Make up my sum.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“It is a strange thing,” says Bacon, “to note the excess of this
passion, and how it braves the nature and value of things by this,
that the <em>speaking in a perpetual hyperbole</em> is comely in nothing
but in love.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is the nature of all passions to exaggerate: and Love, being
of all passions the most violent, exaggerates the most—more even
than Hate, which alone competes with Love in the power to tinge
every object with the colour of its own spectacles. The lover’s
constant sigh is for something stronger than a superlative; and to
the limit between the sublime and the ridiculous he is absolutely
blind. Like Schumann, every lover calls his Clara “Clarissima,”
and of two superlative facts he is quite certain: That <em>she</em> is the
most wonderful being ever created; and that <em>his</em> passion is the
deepest ever felt by mortal.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!</div>

      <div class='line in38'><span class='sc'>Shakspere.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>If you try to convince him that others have loved as ardently—and
ceased to love, he will smile a cynical smile and then close his
eyes and declaim melodramatically—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>“And I will luve thee still, my dear,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>In such hyperbolic effusions a lover sees no exaggeration, for

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Her feet were much too dainty for such tread.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>And every lover would agree with Coleridge that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Her very frowns are fairer far</div>
      <div class='line'>Than smiles of other maidens are.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“The air I breathe in a room empty of you is unhealthy,”
wrote Keats to his sweetheart; and Burns, in the sketch of his
first love, thus describes the emotional hyperæsthesia produced by
Love: “I didn’t know myself why the tones of her voice made
my heart-strings thrill like an Æolian harp, and particularly why
my pulse beat such a furious rattan when I looked and fingered
over her little hand to pick out the cruel nettle-stings and
thistles.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This is the true ecstasy of Love—the most delicious and
thrilling emotion of which the human soul is capable. Nor is it
necessary to be a poet to feel it. While in Love even a coarser-grained
man “feels the blood of the violet, the clover, and the
lily in his veins” (Emerson). But if Jealousy rouses him, it is
flower-blood no longer that courses in his veins, nor human blood,
but vengeful Spanish wine. It is then that Love’s intoxication
reaches its climax: delirious ecstasy followed by angry waves of
dire despair, rocking and tossing the unhappy victim till he is pale
and sick as death.</p>

<p class='c001'>Like other drunkards, the Love-intoxicated youth sees and
feels everything double. His darling seems doubly beautiful, and
all his joys and sorrows are doubled in intensity. And, like other
drunkards, he imagines that all the world is drunk and reeling;
whereas the rapid oscillation of surrounding objects between the
rosy hue of hope and the gray cloud of doubt, is all in his own
mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>How this erotic intoxication multiplies the lover’s courage and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>confidence in his success! The most insignificant smile raises
him over all obstacles to the summit of his hopes, as easily as a
cloud-shadow climbs a mountain side o’er treetops, rocks, and
snowy walls.</p>

<p class='c001'>How, on her part, it magnifies his heroism, his genius,
converting the most insipid commonplace into an immortal
epigram, full of wit and wisdom!</p>

<p class='c001'>That Lovers’ Hyperbole is nothing but Love-intoxication
shows itself also in the ludicrous tasks they undertake when under
the spell. Who but a lover would ever attempt to gild refined
gold, to paint the lily white, the sky blue? Who mix up physiology,
astronomy, gastronomy, in such an absurd way as in
“sweet-heart,” “honey-moon,” etc.?</p>

<p class='c001'>And when, during the “honey-moon,” the lover recovers from
his intoxication, how surprised he looks, how he rubs his eyes and
wonders where the deuce he has been! He remembers Ovid’s
caution that after wine every woman seems beautiful; he
remembers something about seeing “Helen’s beauty in a brow of
Egypt.” And the girl by his side—he thought she <em>was</em> Helen;
but now, “really—this is most extraordinary: just look at that
large mouth, and that snub-nose—well, I knew she had it, and
thought I loved her all the more for this imperfection, which
proved her human and not a goddess: yet, by Jove, I almost
wish ... in fact, I <em>quite</em> wish, her mouth was smaller and her
nose larger.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Poor deluded youth! He was taken in by Cupid’s favourite
trick of dazzling a lover with a pair of brown or blue orbs, till he
can see nothing else. For this girl, beyond question, has a pair
of eyes which Venus might envy—mid-ocean-blue, with a dewdrop
sparkle, and a mischievous expression that is more commonly
found in brown eyes; and these deep-blue eyes are framed in
with black brows and long black lashes, without which no eyes
are ever perfect, whatever their colour. It was these expressive
orbs, this visible music of the spheres, that ravished all his senses
and made him blind to every other feature of her countenance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus we see how Love comes to be blind. One feature—most
commonly the eyes—dazes the victim so completely that all the
other features are seen but vaguely as in a dream; while the
imagination is ever busy in chiselling them into harmony with the
fine eyes. And it is only after marriage, or assured possession,
that the other features emerge from their blurred vagueness, and
are found less perfect than the fond imagination had painted them.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this eagerness of Love to see only superlative excellence, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>its disposition to imagine a thing perfect if it is not, we get a
deep insight into the mission and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>raison d’être</i></span> of this passion.
If women and men would only try to live up to Love’s exalted
ideal of personal perfection—and most persons <em>could</em> be 50 per
cent more beautiful, if they attended to the laws of hygiene and
cultivated their minds—what a lovely planet this would be!</p>

<p class='c001'>Why have so many of the greatest men of genius been unhappy
in their Love and Marriage? Because they had in their minds
the loveliest visions of possible feminine perfection, but did not
find them realised in life. For a while their pre-eminently strong
imaginations helped them to keep up the illusion; but the truth
would out at last; and in the pangs of disappointment they threw
themselves upon the poetic device of Hyperbole, and tried to
console themselves by painting the images of perfection which did
not exist in life.</p>

<p class='c001'>Love, it is true, is not the only theme which they have
embellished with the ornaments of Hyperbole. A wonderful
example of non-erotic Hyperbole occurs in Macbeth—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood</div>
      <div class='line'>Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather</div>
      <div class='line'>The multitudinous seas incarnadine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Making the green one red.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But as a rule the finest specimens of poetic imagery are to be
found in erotic Hyperbole; and it seems most strange that Goldsmith,
who had so deep an insight into Love, does not mention
this variety at all in his essay on Hyperbole.</p>

<p class='c001'>Love, says Emerson, is “the deification of persons”; and
though the poet, like every other lover, “beholding his maiden,
half-knows that she is not verily that which he worships,” this
does not prevent him from idealising her portrait, and sketching
her as he would like to have her. A few additional specimens of
such poetic Hyperbole may fitly close this chapter—</p>

  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>MIXED MOODS AND PARADOXES</h3>

<p class='c013'>“That they do not rightly wot, whether it be pain or not.”
That is the keynote of Modern Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>To a superficial Anakreon, who knows but its rapturous phase,
Love is all honey and moonshine. The celibate Spinoza, too,
ignorant of the agonies of Love, defined it as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lætitia concomitante
idea causæ externæ</i></span>—a pleasure accompanied by the idea of its
external cause. Burton, on the other hand, claims Love as “a
species of melancholy”; and Cowley sings—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A mighty pain to love it is,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ’tis a pain that pain to miss;</div>
      <div class='line'>But of all pains the greatest pain</div>
      <div class='line'>It is to love, but love in vain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The poets generally have taken a less one-sided view of the

<p class='c013'>Petrarch’s poems, says Shelley, “are as spells which unseal the
inmost enchanted fountains of the delight which is the grief of
love.” In that part of the <cite>Romance of the Rose</cite> which was
written by Jean de Meung, and translated by Chaucer, occur many
similar phrases depicting Love as an <em>emotional paradox</em>: “Also a
sweet hell it is, and a sorrowful paradise;” “delight right full of
heaviness, and drearihood full of gladness;” “a heavy burden light
to bear;” “wise madness,” “despairing hope,” etc. Mr. Ruskin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>who quotes the whole passage in his <cite>Fors Clavigera</cite>, declares:
“I know of no such lovely love-poem as his since Dante.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As for Dante, he fully realised the “sweet pain” of Love, as he
called it. As far back as Plato’s <cite>Timæus</cite> we find that love, as
then understood, was regarded as “a mixture of pleasure and
pain.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Tis the pest of love,” sings Keats, “that fairest joys bring
most unrest.” Thackeray speaks of “the delights and tortures,
the jealousy and wakefulness, the longing and raptures, the frantic
despair and elation, attendant upon the passion of love.” But it
is superfluous to cite modern authors, for volumes might be filled
with quotations attesting that Love is neither a simple “lætitia,”
as Spinoza defined it, nor “a species of melancholy,” but a mixture
of joy and sadness, of rapture and woe.</p>

<p class='c001'>Shakspere’s “<em>violent sorrow seems a modern ecstasy</em>” might be
adopted as a general motto for a book on the psychology and
history of Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>Love, it is true, is not the only passion characterised by such a
paradoxical mixture of moods. Thus in <cite>Macbeth</cite> the sentence, “on
the torture of the mind to lie in restless ecstasy,” does not refer to
Love; and John Fletcher, too, sings in a general way—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There’s naught in this life sweet</div>
      <div class='line'>If man were wise to see’t,</div>
      <div class='line'>But only melancholy,</div>
      <div class='line'>O sweetest Melancholy!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A German author, Oswald Zimmermann, has even written a
volume of almost two hundred pages, wherein he endeavours to
analyse various emotions and historic phenomena, in which pleasure
and pain are intimately associated. He has chapters on the
Beautiful in Art and in Nature, on Death, on Mysticism, on the
ancient festivals of Dionysus and Aphrodite, on the mediæval
flagellants, on lust and cruelty, on various epochs of modern
literature, etc. His book bears the curious title <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Die Wonne des
Leids</cite></span>, because he holds that there is in these phenomena an
“Ecstasy of Woe,” distinct from pleasure and pain, pure and
simple, and superior to them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hartmann, the pessimist philosopher, goes a step farther, and
claims that “there is <em>no</em> pleasure which does not contain an element
of grief; and no pain without a tinge of pleasure.” This is
obviously an exaggeration; for what is the element of anguish that
enters into the feelings of a successful lover when he imprints the
first kiss on the lips of the girl who has just promised to be his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>wife? or what the element of pleasure in the feelings of a jealous
lover the moment he hears that his rival has won the prize?</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet, if we except a pleasurable or painful climax, like these,
Hartmann’s maxim may be accepted as approximating the truth,
especially in the case of Love, which, more than any other passion,
constantly changes its moods, so that, from their close proximity,
each one cannot fail to rub off some of its colour on the others.
Who but a lover can experience in one brief second both the thrill
of heavenly delight and the sting of deadly anguish—<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Himmelhoch
jauchzend zum Tode betrübt,”</span> as Schiller puts it? A whole
lifetime of emotion is crowded into the one night preceding a
lover’s proposal: hope and fear chasing one another across his weary
brain like a Witches’ Sabbath on the Brocken.</p>

<p class='c001'>One would imagine that the moment when an admirer calls on
his girl, to be fascinated by her smiles and graceful manners, and
to be thrilled by her melodious voice, must be one of unmixed
delight and ecstasy. But if the slightest doubt as to her feelings
lurks in his mind, he is much more apt to be harassed by a
peculiar bitter-sweet feeling. Will he make a good impression on
her this time? he will ask himself; has she perhaps changed, or
found another more acceptable admirer, and is she going to hint as
much by her altered manner? These and a hundred other apprehensions
will torture and depress him; so that he will more than
probably lose that “easy manner and gay address” which are such
mighty weapons in winning a woman’s heart.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor is the girl, on her part, free from the anguish of doubt.
Though her admirer seems to be truly devoted to her, she has
read in the song that “all men are not gay deceivers,” which
somehow seems to imply logically that most men <em>are</em> gay deceivers.
Perhaps, she will muse, he will only worship me as long as I leave
him in absolute doubt as to my feelings; and subsequently, having
gratified his vanity and secured my photograph, he will place it in
his album to show to all his friends as his latest conquest, and
then flit to another flower.</p>

<p class='c001'>After all, Schopenhauer was right in saying that when we have
no great sorrows the imagination invents small ones which torment
us quite as much as the others. When one sees the peculiar
delight lovers take in teasing and torturing each other, one feels
tempted to believe with Zimmermann that there <em>is</em> <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“eine Lust am
Schmerze”</span>—that pain in itself contains a gratification, an “ecstasy
of woe,” distinct from positive pleasure itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet it is hardly necessary to take refuge in such an emotional
paradox in order to account for the value and luxury of Lovers’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Quarrels and all the various mixed moods of Love. A sufficient
explanation is afforded by the principles of <em>Contrast</em> and emotional
<em>Persistence</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Owing to the fact that feeling seems to have a regular pulsation
or rhythm, our hours of anguish are always interrupted by intervals
of hope and happy retrospection—as in Chopin’s funeral march,
where the gloomy dirge is interrupted for a time by a delicious
melody of happy reminiscence, like a heavenly voice of consolation.
When the nervous tension has become too great the string breaks
and the bow resumes its straightness and elasticity. Hence it is
that an uncertain lover actually gloats over the anguish of doubt
and jealousy: for he has an instinctive fore-feeling that when the
reaction of hope and confidence will come, he will enjoy an ecstasy
of the imagination of which an always confident love has no conception.</p>

<p class='c001'>Uninterrupted enjoyment of lovers’ bliss would soon dull the
edge of pleasure, as an unbroken succession of sweet concords in
music would cloy the æsthetic sense. The introduction of discords
raises a longing for their resolution which, if gratified, restores to
the concords their original charm and freshness, and thus prolongs
the pleasures of music. A tourist after spending a month on the
top of a Swiss mountain becomes comparatively indifferent to the
scene of which he knows every detail by heart; but let his peak
be hidden in dense clouds for a few days, and he cannot fail, on
emerging again into sunlight, to greet the view with the same
thrill of delight as on the day of his arrival.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is their constant and unexpected changes from joy to sadness,
from tears to smiles, that constitute the greatest charm of Heine
and Chopin and make them the lyric poet and musician <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>par
excellence</i></span> for lovers. Either a gladsome rainbow suddenly appears
to illumine their lurid landscape; or, again, “their plenteous joys,
wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves in drops of sorrow.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Even the famous</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For ought that I could ever read,</div>
      <div class='line'>Could ever hear by tale or history,</div>
      <div class='line'>The course of true love never did run smooth”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>what is it but another way of stating that that Love which has
met with no impediments, in which anguish and delight have not
warmed one another by mutual friction, has never broken out into
a conflagration sufficiently brilliant to be recorded “by tale or
history” as a remarkable specimen of “true love.” It is the
plot-interest that fascinates the reader as well as the lover himself;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>it is the impediments and emotional conflicts, the <em>coyness of
fate</em>, that constitute the principal charm in a tale of love; and it
would take a very clever novelist to attract readers by an account
of a courtship of which the happy result was a foregone conclusion
at every stage.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus the magic effect of contrasted emotions suggests why
pleasure alternating with woe in Love is more intense than
pleasure uninterrupted. A mountaineer who has been wading
through snowfields all day up to his knees enjoys the comforts of
his slippers, a bright fire, and a cup of tea in the evening, twice as
much as a man who has been all day at home.</p>

<p class='c001'>On reflection, however, it seems as if Contrast, far from reducing
things to their first principles, itself needed an explanation.
<em>Why</em> is it that by contrasting two emotions we heighten their
colour? A partial explanation was, indeed, suggested in speaking
of discords: anguish begets desire, and the more intense desire
has been, the more lively is its gratification. A more profound
solution of the problem, however, is found in the fact that feelings
have their <em>echoes</em>, which continue sometimes long after the original
tone has ceased; and if meantime a new tone is sounded, it blends
with the echo and produces a mixed feeling.</p>

<p class='c001'>The sense of Temperature affords a simple illustration of this
“echo.” Place two basins before you, one filled with tepid, the
other with ice-cold, water. Put your right hand in the ice-water
one minute, leaving the left in your pocket. Then put both
hands into the tepid water. It will seem still tepid to the left,
but quite warm to the right hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some psychologists, however, deny that pleasures and pains
ever coalesce into one feeling—that there is such a thing as a
mixed feeling. They contend that the attention can be fixed on
only one feeling at a time, that the stronger crowds out the
weaker, and that it is only their rapid succession that makes two
feelings appear simultaneous, just as a firebrand swung around
rapidly <em>seems</em> to form a fiery circle.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now it is quite true that the <em>attention</em> can be fixed on only
one feeling at any given moment, and that the stronger crowds
out the weaker so far as the attention is concerned: yet this does
not prevent the prevailing feeling from being affected by the echo
of the one which preceded it. If a man, buried in the labyrinths
of a big hotel, is waked up in the night by cries of fire; though it
may prove a false alarm, yet the effect of the fright will remain
with him and cast a gloom over his whole day’s doings, however
pleasant in themselves. And a doubtful lover’s enjoyment of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>sweetheart’s sweetest smiles is often galled by the remembrance
that on the preceding day she smiled just as sweetly on his odious
rival. “For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done,” says
Shakspere.</p>

<p class='c001'>In his admirable <cite>Dissertation on the Passions</cite>, Hume cleverly
makes use of a musical analogy to explain how different emotions
may be mixed: “If we consider the human mind, we shall
observe that, with regard to the passions, it is not like a wind-instrument
of music, which, in running over all the notes, immediately
loses the sound when the breath ceases; but rather resembles
a string-instrument, where, after each stroke, the vibrations still
retain some sound which gradually and insensibly decays. The
imagination is extremely quick and agile, but the passions in
comparison are slow and restive; for which reason, when any
object is presented which affords a variety of views to the one and
emotions to the other, though the fancy may change its views
with great celerity, each stroke will not produce a clear and distinct
note of passion, but the one passion will always be mixt and
confounded with the other.”</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Lunatic, Lover, and Poet.</em>—A still better analogy of the manner
in which one feeling may be modified by another is furnished by
the optical phenomenon of after-images. If we gaze very steadily
for half a minute at a green wafer and then at a sheet of white
paper, we see on it a <em>purple</em> image of the wafer; purple being the
complementary colour of green, <i>i.e.</i> the colour which, if mixed
with green, produces white. The reason of this phenomenon is
that, after looking at the green wafer, the nervous fibres in the
eye which perceive that colour have become so fatigued that the
fainter green waves in the white paper fail to make any perceptible
impression on them; so that purple alone prevails for the
moment. So to the infatuated swain who has been tortured by
the green-eyed monster, Jealousy, the moment of remission, which
would else be one of neutral indifference, assumes the hue of rosy
hope and positive delight. Hours which to sober mortals would
seem perfect blanks are thus to him full of intense feeling, simply
because they are rebounds from a state of extreme tension in the
opposite direction. He might be likened to a schoolboy whose
sleigh is carried across the frozen river by its downward impetus
and even ascends the hill on the other side some distance before it
stops. Hence, like the madman and the man of genius, the
amorous swain is always either down in a fit of melancholy, or in
an exalted ecstasy of joy, rapidly alternating and weirdly intermingled—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“The lunatic, the lover, and the poet,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are of imagination all compact.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Now poets are proverbially melancholy; and madmen, as
Professor Krafft-Ebing tells us, are also more commonly tortured
by depressing delusions than elated by pleasant ones. Hence, if
the poet’s maxim, just quoted, be true, we should expect the
lover’s prevailing cast of mind to be melancholy too; and so it is.
Though he enjoys moments of delirious rapture, to which sober
mortals are utter strangers, yet his misgivings are incessant, even
when he is almost certain of success: and it takes but little to
poison his cup; for, as Professor Volkmann remarks, “one drop
of anguish suffices to gall a whole ocean of joy.” So the lover
becomes “pale and interesting,” loses weight and appetite, and
sighs away his soul. Were this emotional fermenting process
allowed to last too long, his health would suffer seriously: but
fortunately it ordinarily ceases in a year or so, yielding a wine
which, though less sparkling and ebullient, is more mellow and
less intoxicating. Romantic Love, in other words, is metamorphosed
into conjugal affection which, among other attributes of
Love, strips off its characteristic trait of melancholy, whereby it
is easily distinguished from all other forms of affection. Before,
however, we can pass on to consider in detail the differences
between Romantic and Conjugal Love, the two remaining ingredients
of Romantic Love—Individual Preference and Personal
Beauty—must be briefly considered.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCE</h3>

<p class='c013'>It happens occasionally, in the Western regions of the United
States, that an Indian brave casts his eyes on a buxom pale-face
girl and desires her in marriage. He offers her parents two
ponies for her; he offers three, five, and even seven ponies; and
when still refused he is the most mystified man in the world:
cannot understand how any man can be so egregiously stupid or
avaricious as to refuse his daughter for <em>seven</em> ponies! Ugh!!</p>

<p class='c001'>It is needless to recapitulate the numerous instances cited in
preceding pages, showing that throughout the world, until within
a few centuries, Romantic Love could not exist because the girl’s
choice, on the one hand, was utterly ignored, while the man, on
the other, was equally prevented, by the lack of opportunities for
courtship, from basing his choice on a real knowledge of the
selected bride. The parents who did the selecting, always for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>bride, and sometimes even for the bridegroom, were guided in their
choice by money and rank and not by Health and Beauty, which
inspire Love and follow as its fruits. The history of Love, till
within three or four centuries ago, might, in short, be summed up
in six words: No Choice, no Love, no Beauty—except in those
rare cases where special hygienic advantages prevailed, or where
lucky chance brought together a youth and a maiden who in the
ordinary course of events would have fallen in Love with one
another.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is reason to believe, however, that even if in the early
ages of the world the young had been allowed greater freedom in
choosing a lover, Romantic Love, in its more ardent phases, would
not have flourished to any great extent among primitive, ancient,
and mediæval nations: for the reason that Love depends on
Individualisation, and our remote ancestors were not so diversely
individualised as we are.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Sexual Divergence.</em>—Comparative ethnology, psychology, and
biology show that specialisation is a product of higher evolution,
<i>i.e.</i> that individual traits are developed in proportion as we proceed
higher in the scale of life, physical and intellectual. It is
true there are no two flowers in the fields, no two leaves in a
forest, exactly alike in every detail: but the differences are
infinitesimal, and almost require a microscope to see them. It is
also true that the sheep in a flock, which appear almost alike to a
casual observer, are individually known to the shepherd. <em>Possibly</em>
a sharp-sighted and patient naturalist might live to distinguish
himself by distinguishing the individuals in a swarm of bees, or a
caravan of ants: but this would be counted little short of a
miracle.</p>

<p class='c001'>Furthermore, ordinary observers find it almost as difficult to
distinguish individuals in a crowd of Chinese, Negroes, or Indians,
as in a bee-hive. Closer acquaintance does reveal differences:
but they are rarely so great as those between individuals in civilised
communities. And in these civilised communities themselves
we find greater differences, sexual differences pre-eminently, the
higher we ascend. Between a peasant and his wife the difference,
both physical and mental, is surely not half so great as that
between a lawyer and his wife, a physician or professor and his
wife. “The lower the state of culture,” says Professor Carl Vogt,
“the more similar are the occupations of the two sexes;” and
similarity of occupation entails similarity of attitude, expression,
and mental habits. Mr. Higginson’s notion that civilisation tends
to make the sexes more and more alike is true only as regards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>legal rights and social privileges; regarding their mental traits
and physical appearance exactly the reverse is true. The peasant’s
wife may have a tender heart for him and her children, but her
domestic drudgery and hard labour in the fields make her features,
her voice, and manners harsh and masculine. And who has not
read a hundred times that the Indian squaws look quite as stern,
stolid, unemotional, and masculine as their husbands?</p>

<p class='c001'>That the ancient Greeks, though they may have possessed it,
had but little regard for Individuality is shown especially in their
sculpture, and in the fact that with them even marriage was considered
less a private than a social matter. Lycurgus, Solon, and
Plato agreed in viewing marriage as “a matter in which the state
had a right to interfere;” and for the purpose of providing the
state with legitimate citizens, it was therefore regarded as obligatory.
The absence of emotional expression in Greek statues equally
shows their indifference to Individualisation and their ignorance of
Love: for Love is inspired not so much by regularity of features
as by fascinating variety of emotional expression.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus the absence or disregard of individual traits among ancient
nations helps, like the absence of individual Choice, to account for
the absence of Romantic Love, the very essence of which—as distinguished
from mere sexual passion—is the insistance on individual
traits and the mutual adaptation of the lovers.</p>

<p class='c001'>What sublime—or ridiculous—extremes, this absorption in
individual traits reaches in Modern Love, no one need be told.
Not only does the lover consider his maiden’s frowns more beautiful
than other maidens’ smiles, but he longs to kiss the floor on
which she has walked; and every ribbon that has clasped her
waist, every jewel that has touched her ear or neck, becomes
charged with a subtle and mysterious electric current that would
shock him with a thrill of recognition should his fingers come in
contact with them on a table, even in a dark room.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Making Women Masculine.</em>—Nothing proves so irrefutably the
hopelessness of the task undertaken by a few “strong-minded”
women—namely, to equalise the sexes by making women more
masculine—than the fact thus revealed by anthropology and history:
that the tendency of civilisation has been to make men and
women more and more unlike, physically and emotionally. Whatever
approximation there may have been has been entirely on the
part of the men, who have become less coarse or “manly,” in the
old acceptation of that term, and more femininely refined; while
women have endeavoured to maintain the old distance by a corresponding
increase of refinement on their part. Should the Woman’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Rights viragoes ever succeed in establishing their social ideal, when
women will share all the men’s privileges, make stump speeches,
and—of course—go back to the harvest fields and to war with
them—then good-bye, Romantic Love! But there is no danger
that these Amazons will ever carry their point. They might as
well try to convince women to wear beards; or men, crinolines.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were any further proof needed that the sexes have been continually
diverging instead of converging, it would be found in the
fact that the young of both sexes are more alike than adults: in
accordance with the law that the individual goes through the same
stages of development as the race. And there are embryological
facts which indicate even that there is some truth in the Platonic
myth that the sexes at first were not separated; but that such
separation took place probably for three reasons: to secure a
division of labour; to prevent the full hereditary transmission of
injurious qualities; and, thirdly, to secure the benefits of cross-fertilisation,—a
result which in the higher spheres of human life
is attained through Love, which is based on opposite or complementary
qualities, and scorns near relationship.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Love and Culture.</em>—The dependence of Love on Individualisation,
and the dependence of Individualisation, in turn, on Culture,
help us also to explain an apparent difficulty regarding the non-existence
of Love among the lower classes in ancient Greece and
elsewhere. For these classes were not subjected to the same
chaperonage as the higher circles: and it might be inferred therefore
that the possibility of free Choice must have led to real love-matches.
Perhaps it did in those rare cases where culture had
sent a rootlet down into a lower social stratum. But as a rule one
would have looked in vain among the lower classes—as one does
to-day, despite poetic fiction—for minds sufficiently refined to
comprehend and feel the highly-complex and idealised group of
emotions which constitute Romantic Love. Of course it would be
absurd to include in this statement people of refinement who
through misfortune have been plunged into abject poverty. They
do not belong to the “Great Unwashed”—ὁἱ πολλοί.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Stendhal asserts that in France Love exists only in the
lower classes, while Max Nordau states that in Germany it is to
be found in the higher classes only, they are probably both right—allowance
being made for rare exceptions. What Love <em>does</em>
exist in France—and it is preciously scarce—cannot possibly prevail
except among the working people; and in Germany among the
corresponding class it must be equally scarce, whereas in the middle
and higher classes, where chaperonage is not nearly so strict and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>idiotic as in France, Cupid does contrive to find an occasional
target for his arrows.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>PERSONAL BEAUTY</h3>

<p class='c013'>Fanny Brawne having complained to Keats that he seemed to
ignore all her other qualities and have eyes for her beauty alone,
Keats thus justified himself: “Why may I not speak of your
beauty, since without that I could never have loved you? I cannot
conceive any beginning of such love as I have for you but
beauty. There may be a sort of love for which, without the least
sneer at it, I have the highest respect, and can admire it in
others: but it has not the richness, the bloom, the full form, the
enchantment of love after my own heart.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Fanny Brawne is not the only girl who has thus complained to
her lover about his exclusive emphasising of her Personal Beauty.
But all such complaints are useless. In Modern Love the Admiration
of Personal Beauty is by far the strongest of all ingredients,
and is becoming more so every year: fortunately, for thereby
Romantic Love is becoming more and more idealised and converted
into a pure æsthetic sentiment. Goldsmith, indeed, laid stress on
the virtue of choosing a wife on the same principle that guided her
in choosing a wedding-ring—for qualities that will wear. But
Personal Beauty <em>does</em> wear, with proper hygienic care.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Feminine Beauty in Masculine Eyes.</em>—In masculine Love,
regard for youthful feminine Beauty has always played a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span> more
or less important. But the effects of this kind of sexual selection
in the lower races in increasing the amount of physical beauty in
the world, have been commonly neutralised by the crude æsthetic
notions prevailing among men as to what constituted feminine
beauty. The weakness of the æsthetic overtone in Love, moreover,
has hitherto prevented it from competing successfully with
other marriage-motives. On the continent of Europe, to this day,
the ugliest girl with a dowry of a few thousands is sure to find a
husband and transmit her bodily and his mental ugliness to her
offspring; while girls who could transmit a considerable amount of
beauty, physical and mental, to their children, are left to fade away
as old maids, because they have no money.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this respect America sets a noble example to most parts of
Europe. Thousands of young Americans marry penniless beauties
every year, although they might have rich ugly girls for the asking.
This is one of the things Frenchmen and Germans cannot understand,
and class as “Americanisms.” And then they wonder why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>it is that there are so many pretty girls in Canada and the United
States. Another “Americanism,” gentlemen. These pretty girls
are the issue of Love-matches. Their mothers were selected for
their Beauty, not for money or rank.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not but that there are numerous exceptions to this golden rule
of Love. Were there not, ugly women would be scarcer than they
are, even in America.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Masculine Beauty in Feminine Eyes.</em>—In woman’s Love the
admiration of Personal Beauty has played a much less significant
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span> than in man’s Love. If, nevertheless, the average man in
most countries is perhaps a better specimen of masculine Beauty
than the average woman of feminine Beauty, this is owing to the
facts that sons as well as daughters may inherit their mother’s
beauty, and that men, leading a more active and athletic life, are
more beautiful than women in proportion as they are more
healthy.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the past barbarous times the constant wars and the unsettled
state of social affairs made it important for women to select men
not for their beauty, but for their <a id='corr178.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='energy'>energy,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_178.19'><ins class='correction' title='energy'>energy,</ins></a></span> courage, and manly
prowess. Desdemona falls in Love with the Moor despite his
colour and ugliness; and why? Othello himself tells us—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“She loved me for the dangers I had passed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I loved her that she did pity them.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And it is on beholding Orlando vanquishing the Duke’s wrestler
that Rosalind falls in Love with him. As Celia remarks: “Young
Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler’s heels and your heart, both
in an instant.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Women are conservative; and in the ludicrous feminine eagerness
to make immortal heroes of the ephemeral victors in a boat-race
or baseball match, we see an echo, in these peaceful days, of a
feminine trait imprinted on them in warlike times.</p>

<p class='c001'>Intellectual supereminence, in the meantime, was ignored by
women. Petrarch’s verses made no impression on Laura, and
Dante could not even win Beatrice with such poetic beauties as
these lines—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Whatever her sweet eyes are turned upon,</div>
      <div class='line'>Spirits of Love do issue thence in flame,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which through their eyes who then may look on them</div>
      <div class='line'>Pierce to the heart’s deep chamber every one.</div>
      <div class='line'>And in her smile Love’s image you may see</div>
      <div class='line'>Whence none can gaze upon her steadfastly.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There is, however, already a large class of superior women who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>have discovered that brains have displaced muscle in the successful
struggle for existence, and that strong nerves are the true storage-batteries
of courage and vigour in modern life. Hence the homage
paid to men of genius.</p>

<p class='c001'>In regard to masculine Beauty a change likewise has come over
the feminine mind. Fashionable young ladies appear, indeed, to
be as exacting in the matter of what they consider Personal Beauty
as their beaux are. A barber’s pet is their pet, even as the fashionable
man’s ideal of femininity is a milliner’s model. There can be
hardly any doubt that this is an improvement on the taste of those
savages who prefer their women black, with thick lips, flat noses,
and tattooed, or smeared with a half-inch coat of paint.</p>

<p class='c001'>Says a writer in the <cite>London Magazine</cite> (1823): “The pale
poet, whose works enchant us all, is nobody in the park: with his
shrunk cheeks and spindle legs, he sneaks along as little noticed
as a fly; while a thousand fond eyes are fixed on the gay and
handsome apprentice there, with just enough intellect to make the
clothes which make him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Serves the pale poet quite right. His genius does not give
him any right to neglect his health, or to allow the tailor’s apprentice
to surpass him in attention to his personal appearance. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Génie
oblige.</i></span> And whether geniuses or not, men should pay just as
much attention to their dress and personal attractiveness as women.</p>

<p class='c001'>A convincing illustration of my thesis that Personal Beauty is
to-day a more important factor in woman’s Love than formerly, is
afforded by the circumstance that formerly Love had the effect of
making a man neglect his beard, and hands, and clothes, and indulge
in general slovenliness, as we see in Rosalind’s summary of
the symptoms of masculine Love, as well as in various passages in
Cervantes and other authors; whereas to-day it is just the reverse,
as noted under the head of Gallantry. It is most amusing to
watch a man smitten with sudden passion: how carefully he adjusts
his cravat, curls his moustache, brushes his hat and boots, polishes
his finger-nails, removes spots from his coat, regards himself in the
mirror, and—wishes he were a millionaire.</p>

<p class='c001'>So much for the general relations between Love and Beauty.
It now remains to consider in detail what peculiarities of personal
appearance are and have been specially favoured by Love. This
involves an æsthetico-anatomical analysis of every part of the human
body from toe to top. To this analysis almost one half of this
work will be devoted—showing the preponderating importance of
Personal Beauty over the other factors in Modern Love. But
before proceeding to this pleasant task it will be well, for the sake
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>of continuity, to discuss the remaining aspects of Modern Love:
how it differs from conjugal affection; how men of genius behave
when in Love; what are the peculiarities of the physical expression
of Love in features and actions; how Love maybe won and cured;
and how the leading modern nations differ in their amorous peculiarities.
A consideration of Schopenhauer’s theory of Love will
then naturally lead us to the second part of this treatise, in which
Personal Beauty alone will form our theme.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>CONJUGAL AFFECTION AND ROMANTIC LOVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps the main reason why no one has anticipated me in
writing a book showing that Love is an exclusively modern sentiment,
and tracing its gradual development, is because no distinction
has been commonly made between Romantic Love and Conjugal
Affection, though they differ as widely as maternal love and friendship.
The occurrence of noble examples of conjugal attachment
as far back as Homer has obscured the fact that pre-nuptial or
Romantic Love is almost as modern as the telegraph, the railway,
and the electric light.</p>

<p class='c001'>Two thousand and four hundred years ago the Greek philosopher
Empedokles taught that there are four elements—fire, air, water,
earth—which remain unchanged amid all combinations. Chemistry
has long since shown that these supposed elements are compounds,
and that the number of real elements is much larger.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a similar way the tender or family emotions have been gradually
distinguished from one another. Among the ancient Greeks
φιλότης meant both friendship and sexual love, which, as we have
seen, they strangely confounded, both in theory and in practice.
To-day we distinguish not only between friendship and sexual love,
but between the two phases of sexual love—Romantic and Conjugal
Affection—the former of which was unknown to the Greeks.
We do this not only because, as in the case of the chemical
elements, our knowledge has become more precise and subtle, but
because these emotions have been gradually developed, and have
assumed different characteristics, so that it would be difficult at
present to mistake one for the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>As regards the difference between Conjugal and Romantic Love,
however, the current conceptions are not yet so clear and definite;
many good folks being, in fact, inclined to frown upon the suggestion
that there is any such difference. Yet it is useless for them
to endeavour, with well-meant hypocrisy, to impress upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>young the notion that Love is unchangeable, since no one who
keeps his eyes open can help noticing how differently married
couples behave from lovers. In marriage the dazzling blue flame
of Romantic Love gradually grows smaller and dies away. But
the coals may retain their glow and perchance keep the heart
warmer than the former flickering flames of Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is, indeed, a great moral advantage to be gained by
frankly acknowledging that Love undergoes a metamorphosis in
wedlock. It <em>breaks the sting of cynicism</em>. For if we are told that
“marriage is the sunset of love,” or that “the only sure cure for
love is marriage,” we may calmly retort, “What of it?” When
the romantic passion subsides, its place is taken by another group
of emotions, equally noble and conducive to the welfare of society.
It is not an annihilation of anything, but simply a change: losing
some pleasures, but gaining others in their place; getting rid of
some pains to be burdened with others. Love’s metamorphosis
into conjugal affection is like that of a wild rose into its red berry.
Though less fragrant and lovely than the rose, the berry is almost
as warm in colour, endures longer, and brings forth fresh plants to
adorn future seasons.</p>

<p class='c001'>Similes, however, are not arguments; and it behoves us therefore,
for the benefit of bachelors and old maids, and of married folks
who never were in love, to point out definitely wherein conjugal
differs from Romantic Love; which at the same time will explain
why conjugal affection was able to exist so many centuries before
Romantic Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>In preceding pages a fragmentary attempt has been made to
characterise Love, and to show how its growth was impeded through
the inferior social and intellectual status of women and the absolute
chaperonage of the young. Maidens and youths had no opportunity
to meet and become acquainted. Barter, and considerations
of rank and expediency, took the place of affection, and parental
authority that of individual choice. There was no prolonged
courtship, hence no jealousy of rivals, no female coyness and
coquetry, no alternating hopes and doubts, no monopoly of mutual
admiration, no ecstatic adoration, sympathetic sharing of lovers’
joys and griefs, or pride of conquest and possession.</p>

<p class='c001'>Conjugal affection, on the other hand, was much less retarded
in its growth by such artificial arrangements, the outcome of
strong man’s brutal selfishness. Polygamy was the chief impediment;
but as soon as woman became sufficiently “emancipated”
to claim a husband of her own, the soil was ready for the growth
of conjugal affection. In its early stages this form of affection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>must have been much more crude and simple than it is in modern
society. In most instances it was probably little more than a
mere superficial attachment, growing out of the habit of living
together for some time; the husband being attached to his wife
on account of the domestic comforts and ease she provided for
him, and the wife to the husband very much as a dog is to his
master, who, though cruel, yet takes care of and feeds him.</p>

<p class='c001'>How crudely utilitarian the conjugal bond is among primitive
men may be inferred from Mr. Wallace’s remarks already quoted
as to the motives which guide the maidens of certain Amazon-valley
tribes in choosing their husbands. There is, he says, “a
trial of skill at shooting with the bow and arrow, and if the
young man does not show himself a good marksman, the girl
refuses him, on the ground that he will not be able to shoot fish
and game enough for the family.”</p>

<p class='c001'>With the ancient “classical” nations there were, unless the
poets have strongly idealised their characters, examples of conjugal
affection hardly differing from the most refined modern instances.
Owing to the then prevalent contempt for the female mind, however,
such cases cannot be accepted as fair samples of the “general
article”; and they only allow us to infer that, as with Love and
with genius, so with conjugal affection, there were some early
perfect instances anticipating by many centuries the general course
of emotional evolution.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the dark and warlike mediæval ages Conjugal Love, on the
woman’s side, was apparently little more, as a rule, than a sense
of devotion to her husband based on her need of protection against
barbarous enemies; and what it was on the husband’s side may be
inferred from his stern and often tyrannic rule in his own house,
which was calculated to breed in his wife and children fear but
neither conjugal nor filial affection.</p>

<p class='c001'>In modern Conjugal Affection the elements are as diverse and
as variously intermingled as in Love, if not more so; and it
would be as difficult to find two cases of conjugal love exactly
alike as two human faces, or two leaves in a forest. One man
cherishes his wife chiefly on account of the home comfort she
provides—the neat and tasteful domestic interior, the well-cooked
dinners, the economic attention to household affairs, etc. Another
man’s pride in his spouse is based on her conversational skill, her
diplomatic art of asserting her place among the upper ten in
society, and of adorning her drawing-rooms with the presence of
prominent people of the day. A third husband loves his wife
for her artistic accomplishments or her personal charms. Still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>another, an author, is devoted to his spouse because she cleverly
assists his labours by criticism and suggestion, and still more
because she takes such a sympathetic interest in his creations, and
<em>really</em> thinks that no one since Shakspere has written like her
own dear Adolphus.</p>

<p class='c001'>These and a thousand like circumstances, with their attendant
feelings, enter into the highly complex group of emotions subsumed
under the name of Conjugal Love. Yet, since any one of these
feelings may be absent without extinguishing Conjugal Affection,
they cannot be regarded as its essentials or framework, but only
as colouring material.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor is that which is commonly regarded as the strongest of all
cements between husband and wife—the common love of their
children—to be accepted as the essence of conjugal love. For
childless couples present many of the most remarkable cases of
devotion, while in many other cases the children not only fail to
rekindle the torch of love, but even arouse jealousies and ill-feeling
between their parents by showing a special preference for one or
the other. Nevertheless, though not absolutely essential to
conjugal love, the common parental feeling is one of its most
important and constant ingredients; and there is none of its
tributaries which adds more to the deep current of connubial bliss.
It enables the parents to enjoy once more the simple pleasures of
life, to which they had grown callous; it brings back the
peculiarly delicious memories of their own childhood and youth;
enables the father to discover his former sweetheart renewed in
his daughter, and the mother her former lover in her son; while
their common pride in the beauty or accomplishments of the
children supplies them with a never-failing topic of conversation
and source of sympathy.</p>

<p class='c001'>And this suggests what must be regarded as the real kernel of
conjugal attachment—a perennial mutual sympathy regarding not
only the affairs of their children but every other domestic affair—in
other words, a complete and <em>necessary</em> harmony of feelings and
interests. The accent rests on the word <em>necessary</em>; for it is this
feeling of necessary communion of interests that distinguishes
conjugal affection from Love and from friendship, in both of
which there is a mutual sympathy, but not so far-reaching and
inevitable. A lover’s fame or disgrace may be keenly felt by his
sweetheart or his friend, yet society does not associate them with
the other’s reputation or disgrace; and if the infamy is too great,
they can easily sever their bond, without leaving a spot on their
own good name. Not so with husband and wife. His promotion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>is her honour, and his fall her humiliation; for they are inseparably
associated in the public mind, and cannot be parted except
through divorce, which is equivalent to social suicide. Therefore
theirs is “one glory an’ one shame,” and their destiny to “share
each other’s gladness and weep each other’s tears.”</p>

<p class='c001'>To make this matrimonial harmony complete, it is necessary
that there should be a real sense of companionship, <i>i.e.</i> common
tastes and topics of conversation. “Unlikeness may attract,”
says Mill, “but it is likeness which retains; and in proportion to
the likeness is the suitability of the individuals to give each other
a happy life.” The opposite qualities by which lovers are often
attracted are chiefly of a physical nature. Where the mental
differences are great—where he, for instance, is fond of books and
music, while she wishes his books and his piano in Siberia; or
she fond of parties, pictures, and theatres, and he bored to death
by them: in such cases genuine Romantic Love cannot survive a
few weeks of constant companionship, and hopes of nuptial bliss
must end in disappointment.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>ROMANCE IN CONJUGAL LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Horwicz places the essence of Conjugal Love in the feeling of
being indissolubly united; and this agrees substantially with our
conclusion that it lies in a necessary mutual Sympathy concerning
every affair of vital interest. Now if this <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>obligato</i></span> Sympathy is
facilitated by a communion of tastes, as just suggested, there is
no reason why conjugal life should not retain some of the other
elements which constitute the charm of Romantic Love. Novelists
and dramatists will perhaps continue to avoid wedded life as a
theme because it lacks the plot-interest, the uncertainty, and the
consequent Mixed Moods of pre-nuptial Love. Emotional Hyperbole,
too, will rarely survive the honeymoon, for, as Addison
remarks, “When a man becomes familiar with his goddess, she
quickly sinks into a woman.” Yet a woman, too, is not such a
bad thing after all, if you know how to manage her. Jealousy is
a trait of Romantic Love that is only too apt to survive in
marriage. By a judicious use of its sting a neglected wife can
bring her husband back to her feet. But it is a double-edged
tool, dangerous to toy with. The Pride of Conquest becomes
changed into Pride of Possession or a vain feeling of Proprietorship,
which will continue so long as the husband or the wife
retains those self-sacrificing qualities which distinguished them
during Courtship—which, however, rarely happens. Where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>possession is assured and sanctioned by law, Coyness is of course
out of the question; yet a clever woman can by a judicious
adaptation of the arts of Flirtation do much to keep alive the
glowing coals of former romantic passion. All she has to do is
to devise some novel methods of fascinating the husband, and
then keep him at a distance till he resumes the tricks of devoted
Gallantry which had once made him such an acceptable lover.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is the growing indifference to Gallantry, to the Desire to
Please, active and passive, that is responsible for the usual
absence of romance in conjugal life. And there seems to be a
general ungallant consensus among writers, masculine and
feminine, that women are more responsible for this state of affairs
than men. “The reason,” says Swift, “why so few marriages
are happy, is because young ladies spend their time in making
nets, not in making cages.” Young ladies have, no doubt, greatly
improved since the days of Swift; but in the vast majority of
cases their device still is to learn a few superficial tricks of
“culture,” and to practise the art of personal adornment, until
they have caught a husband, and then to bid good-bye to all
music, and art, and study, and improvement of the mind, as well
as to the “bother” of attending to Personal Beauty while the
husband <em>only</em> is about. As if it were not a thousand times more
important to retain the husband’s romantic adoration and
Gallantry, originally based on that beauty, than to enjoy the
momentary admiration of a third person!</p>

<p class='c001'>On this topic the German poet Bodenstedt has some remarks
which show that, after all, the excessive Oriental Jealousy which
forbids women to appear unveiled in public rests on a basis of
common sense:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Just as it is possible to trace most absurdities to an originally
quite reasonable idea, so not a few things may be said in favour of
the Oriental custom which allows women to adorn themselves only
for their husband, and to unveil their face only before him, while
outside of the house it is their duty to appear veiled and in as unattractive
a costume as possible. With us, it is well known, the
opposite is true: at home the women devote little attention to
their toilet, and only adorn themselves when they have company
or go out visiting; in one word, they display their charms and
their finery more to please others than their own husband,” etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>Surely no one wishes our women to reserve their charms exclusively
for their husbands. On the contrary, such a proceeding
would be considered quite as unreasonable and selfish as to lock up
a Titian or a Murillo in a room accessible to a single person only;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>but certainly the husband should not be entirely overlooked in his
wife’s Desire to Please by her Personal Beauty. His Pride on
seeing others admire her does not alone suffice to prolong his
romantic adoration. Don’t be too sure, Amanda, that your
husband is yours because you are married. He is yours in Law,
but not in Love, unless you preserve your personal charms in his
presence.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fact that, whereas in Romantic Love men are superior to
women; in conjugal life, on the other hand, woman’s love is commonly
much deeper and more lasting than man’s, indicates in itself
that marriages are made or marred by women. (For the sake of
the lovely alliteration some writers would have said—against their
conscience—that “marriages are made or marred by men;” but
alliteration will have to be ignored in this place in favour of
facts.) Before marriage, women are more beautiful and fascinating
than men, wherefore men love them more ardently than <em>they</em> love
the men. After marriage, it is the men who grow more beautiful,
more manly, in body as well as in mind; hence it is but natural
that their wives should love them more and more. So would
wives be loved more and more if they did not so soon after thirty
lose their physical charms, without trying, by reading books or at
least the newspapers, to make themselves intellectual companions
of their husbands, able to converse interestingly on various topics.</p>

<p class='c001'>The old excuse that motherhood inevitably lessens woman’s
charms is all nonsense. Married women at thirty are almost
always handsomer than old maids of thirty. Women grow stout
and clumsy, or thin and faded so soon, not because they are
mothers, but because they are indifferent to the laws of health;
because they refuse to go out to get fresh air and exercise, which
would preserve the freshness of their complexion, the graceful contours
of their bodies, and the elasticity of their gait. The morbid
fondness for a hot-house atmosphere, and the horror of fresh air,
draughts, and vigorous exercise, have done more to shorten man’s
Love and woman’s Beauty than all other causes combined. <em>The
road to lasting Love is paved with lasting Beauty.</em></p>

<p class='c001'>Inasmuch as Conjugal Affection was not—as might be naturally
supposed—historically developed from Romantic Love, since it
existed long before Romantic Love, the peculiarities of this later
passion are not normally present in Conjugal Love. To what extent,
however, they can be smuggled in, has just been shown;
and it is one of the great social tasks of the future to make Conjugal
and Romantic Love as much alike as possible: not by making
the poetry of romance more prosaic, but by making the prose of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>conjugal life more poetic. But so long as Romantic Love is
discouraged, Conjugal Affection, too, will of course be unable to
borrow its unique charms. Hence an additional reason for facilitating
the opportunities for Courtship and prolonging its duration.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>MARRIAGES OF REASON OR LOVE-MATCHES?</h3>

<p class='c013'>The number of parents who believe that their infallible wisdom
is a better guide matrimonial than their daughters’ choice inspired
by Love, is still so large that it is worth while to add a few words
in the hope of removing this obstacle to the universal rule of
Cupid. Let Mrs. Lynn-Linton be their spokeswoman. “If it
seems a horrible thing,” she says, in <cite>The Girl of the Period</cite>,
“to marry a young girl without her consent, or without any
more knowledge of the man with whom she is to pass her life
than can be got by seeing him once or twice in formal family
conclave, it seems quite as bad to let our women roam about
the world at the age when their instincts are strongest and their
reason weakest—open to the flatteries of fools and fops—the
prey of professed lady-killers—objects of loverlike attentions by
men who mean absolutely nothing but the amusement of making
love—the subjects for erotic anatomists to study at their pleasure.
Who among our girls after twenty carries an absolutely untouched
heart to the man she marries?”</p>

<p class='c001'>No doubt there is force in these remarks: but they do not
apply to the Girl of the Period. They apply only to the girl
brought up on the old system of being left in complete ignorance
regarding man and his wicked ways of heartless and meaningless
flattery. But modern girls are not such fools as some people
would think them. <em>Tell them</em> that men are only amusing themselves;
a hint will suffice: and the man who imagines himself a
“lady-killer” will suddenly find himself a victim of counter-flirtation
and a butt of feminine sarcasm.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tell girls, furthermore, not that every man loves his wife, but
that many hate and maltreat their unfortunate spouse. This will
make them cautious. Tell them that Love is not an absolute but
a <em>tentative</em> passion, and that they must not yield to the first apparent
symptoms and throw their hearts away frivolously. Tell
them, above all, that men who are extremely gallant and complimentary,
<em>without being in the least embarrassed</em>, are always
insincere and sometimes dangerous: because a man who is truly
in Love is always embarrassed. Tell them a few more such
pessimistic truths about men, instead of allowing them to perish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>through optimistic ignorance, and the objections against free
choice urged by Mrs. Lynn-Linton will vanish like vapour in sunlight.
English and American girls are quite able to take care of
themselves, because they are allowed to read all sorts of books,
and therefore to know the world as it is. And if any one says
that such knowledge has rendered English and American girls less
delicate, less sweet and pure, than French and German hothouse
buds, he utters an unmitigated falsehood.</p>

<p class='c001'>Advocates of so-called “wisdom” marriages are fond of pointing
out cases of unhappy married life, based originally on free
Choice. But free Choice by no means always implies Love. Its
motives are often pecuniary, or social; and in these cases the
marriage actually comes under the head of “wisdom marriages,”
whose champions are thus boxing their own ears. Besides, we must
remember Byron’s words, that “many a man thinks he marries by
choice who only marries by accident.” If a man marries his
Rosaline before he has met his Juliet, he has only himself or his
bad luck to blame, not Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>The frequency with which runaway “love-matches” end unhappily,
is adduced as another argument in favour of wisdom
marriages. Two things are here forgotten: that in nineteen
runaway matches out of twenty, the predominant passion is
frivolity, not Love; and that quite a considerable proportion of
unions not preceded by an elopement end unhappily; but being
less romantic they are not so much talked about.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Wisdom” marriages based on parental choice are those which
have prevailed in the past: and we have seen how beautifully
they coincided with woman’s degradation, ignorance, and social
debasement.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wisdom marriages are incompatible with Courtship, which
becomes a superfluous preliminary to marriage. Modern methods
of Courtship and engagement ordinarily prolong this period to
about a year or two. This is the honeymoon, not of marriage,
but of life itself, the time when earth is a paradise. During
these two years the soul makes more progress in refinement,
maturity, and insight than during any other <em>decade</em> of life. Shall
all this happiness, all this refining influence, be thrown away with
Love?</p>

<p class='c001'>Compatibility of temper is the most important of all prerequisites
to a happy marriage. Should Love be allowed to find
out during Courtship if there is such a compatibility, before it
is too late, or shall the inadequate judgment of parents unite
two souls with as much mutual affinity as oil and water?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Self-sacrifice for their children is considered the noblest of
parental traits. Were Schopenhauer right in claiming that in
Love-matches the parents sacrifice their individual happiness to
the wellbeing of their children—would not this be an additional
motive for abhorring wisdom marriages, in which the interests of
the parents alone are consulted?</p>

<h3 class='c014'>MARRIAGE HINTS</h3>

<p class='c013'>It would be foolish to deny, on the other hand, that Reason
should be consulted as much as possible as long as Love allows
it to have the floor for a moment. Thus men might, before it
is too late, have an eye to Benjamin Franklin’s advice in regard
to large families and the age of marriage.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. F. W. Holland of Boston has collected some statistics concerning
which Mr. Galton says, “One of his conclusions was that
morality is more often found among members of large families than
among those of small ones. It is reasonable to expect this would
be the case, owing to the internal discipline among members of
large families, and to the wholesome sustaining and restraining
effects of family pride and family criticism. Members of small
families are apt to be selfish, and when the smallness of the family
is due to the deaths of many of its members at early ages, it is
some evidence either of weakness of the family constitution, or of
deficiency of common sense or of affection on the part of the parents
in not taking better care of them. Mr. Holland quotes in his letter
to me a piece of advice by Franklin to a young man in search of
a wife, ‘to take one out of a bunch of sisters,’ and a popular saying
that kittens brought up with others make the best pets, because
they have learned to play without scratching. Sir W. Gull has
remarked that those candidates for the Indian Civil Service who
are members of large families are on the whole the strongest.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A second bit of advice given by Franklin is perhaps less unquestionable:
“From the marriages that have fallen under my
observation,” he says, "I am rather inclined to think that early
ones stand the best chances of happiness. The temper and habits
of the young are not become so stiff and uncomplying as when
more advanced in life: they form more easily to each other, and
hence many occasions of disgust are removed.... ‘Late
children,’ says the Spanish proverb, ‘are early orphans.’ With us
in America (1768) marriages are generally in the morning of life;
our children are therefore educated and settled in the world by
noon; and thus, our business being done, we have an afternoon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>and evening of cheerful leisure to ourselves.... By these early
marriages we are blessed with more children; and from the mode
among us founded by nature, every mother suckling and nursing
her own child [1768], more of them are raised. Thence the swift
progress of population among us, unparalleled in Europe."</p>

<p class='c001'>“Marriages,” says Theodore Parker, “are best of dissimilar
materials;” and Coleridge remarks, similarly: “You may depend
upon it that a slight contrast of character is very material to
happiness in marriage.” But would it be possible to find two
individuals who did not present “a slight contrast of character”?
Coleridge apparently did not think much of the average conjugal
union of his day: “To the many of both sexes I am well aware,”
he says, “this Eden of matrimony is but a kitchen-garden, a thing
of profit and convenience, in an even temperature between indifference
and liking.” What a married person wants is “a soul-mate
as well as a house or yoke-mate.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Young men are often warned not to marry for beauty, because
it is but skin-deep. But surely a millimetre of beauty is worth
more than a yard of ugliness, though whitewashed with rank,
money, or general utility. “A thing of beauty is a joy for ever.”</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>OLD MAIDS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>One way in which Romantic Love fulfils its mission of increasing
the amount of Personal Beauty in the world, is by <em>eliminating
ugly and masculine women as Old Maids</em>, and thus preventing
them from transmitting their characteristics to the next generation.
Were it not for the fact that the average man is quite devoid of
æsthetic taste and incapable of ardent Romantic Love, and that
therefore considerations of wealth and social advantages guide him
in his choice of a wife, <em>ugly</em> women would rarely be found outside
the ranks of Old Maids. As it is, it happens only too often that
dowerless beautiful women are condemned to live and die in single
blessedness, while the ugly people fill the world with photographic
copies of themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>Why is it that every refined man feels an instinctive aversion
to <em>masculine</em> women? Because a masculine woman is an exception
to the laws of nature, a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lusus naturæ</i></span>, a monstrosity. We find even
among the lower animals that the females differ widely, as a rule,
in traits and appearance from the males—sometimes so much so
that there are instances on record of females and males having been
for a time supposed to belong to different species; and the differences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>grow greater the more the sexual functions are developed
and specialised. Yet Amazons occur even among animals.
“Characters common to the male,” says Darwin, “are occasionally
developed in the female <em>when she grows old or becomes diseased</em>,
as, for instance, when the common hen assumes the flowing tail-feathers,
hackles, combs, spurs, voice, and even <em>pugnacity</em> of the
cock.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the warlike Greeks, who knew only masculine or mono-sexual
love, Amazons were naturally esteemed, as they did not
clash with their feminine ideal. “How popular a subject the
Amazons were for sculptors,” says Grote, “we learn from the statement
of Pliny that the most distinguished sculptors executed
Amazons, and that this subject was the only one upon which a
direct comparison could be made between them.” But the progress
of time, as we have seen, has more and more differentiated men
and women, in appearance and traits of character; and the modern
ideal of woman is exclusively feminine, <i>i.e.</i> devoid of hackles, spurs,
cock-a-doodle-doo, and pugnacity. Hence the political Virago
movement is an evil which will never make any progress, thanks
to the constant elimination of masculine women through that
adorable process of Sexual Selection known as Modern Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>Masculine women are always condemned to bury their unwomanly
proclivities with their spinster-selves, unless they are very
rich, or unless they can find a correspondingly effeminate man who
wishes to neutralise his abnormalities in his children by marrying
a spouse whose faults are an excess in the opposite direction. In
such a case a virago may possibly even inspire Romantic Love,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mirabile dictu!</i></span></p>

<p class='c001'>An ugly woman, on the other hand, need never despair of finding
a husband; she has at least eight chances of getting married.
In the first place, she may, like a masculine woman, inspire true
Love in a man whose faults are the opposite of hers; secondly, she
may fall in love with a man of faultless proportions, and while in
Love her features will be so transfigured and beautified that he
cannot help returning her Love; thirdly, she may meet a man who,
from want of æsthetic taste, prefers a chromo to a Titian; or a
fourth, who would rather marry an amiable and useful ugly girl than
a spoiled beauty. Wealth and social position supply two more
resources. Accident may favour her, through the absence of
prettier rivals, giving no opportunities for odious comparisons;
and, finally, she may meet an elderly bachelor who has wearied of
his single blessedness and longs for double strife.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for those Old Maids who are neither ugly nor masculine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>some of them are quondam coquettes who practised their arts just
one season too long and “got left” in consequence; others are
girls whom silly methods of chaperonage or ill-luck have prevented
from making the acquaintance of men whom they could have
respected and loved; so that it is often the most refined and intelligent
women who are thus doomed to remain single because
they are unwilling to marry beneath their station, socially or intellectually.
They form that class of whom De Quincey says, that
they “combine more intelligence, cultivation, and thoughtfulness
than any other in Europe—the class of unmarried women above
twenty-five—an increasing class, women who, from mere dignity
of character, have renounced all prospects of conjugal and parental
life rather than descend into habits unsuitable to their birth.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Women who are too ugly to inspire Love may nevertheless feel
proud of being a class of Vestal Virgins who serve the cause of
Love by abstaining from adding to the number of unattractive
people in the world by hereditary transmission. On the other
hand, Old Maids who are blessed with beauty, owe it to the cause
of Love to make every effort, consistent with feminine modesty, to
get married. Not only because their children will be beautiful,
but because a woman who never marries can never experience the
two emotions which do more than any others to ennoble and
mature the feminine mind—conjugal and maternal love.</p>

<p class='c001'>Those Old Maids, however, who have not yet passed their
thirtieth year, may even claim that they represent the most perfect
and advanced type of maidenhood, and look down on girls who
marry before twenty-five as little better than savages. For it is
well known that the age of marriage advances with civilisation.
Among Australians and other savages girls marry at eleven, ten, or
even nine years; among semi-civilised Egyptians, Hindoos, etc.,
the age is from twelve to fourteen; southern European peoples
marry their girls between the ages of fifteen and eighteen; while
with those nations who lead modern civilisation, the average age
of marriage for a woman is now twenty-one, with a tendency to
rise. Does it not follow from this, by inexorable logic, that girls
who remain single at twenty-five or twenty-nine are forerunners of
a still higher type of civilisation? and that the only trouble with
them is that they are so far in advance of their age and civilisation?
True, ungrateful man does not look upon them in that
light; but herein they share the fate of all true greatness. There
is one difference, however, between undervalued men of genius and
Old Maids: the men of genius admit they are in advance of their
age, and are proud of it; the Old Maids never, at least, hardly ever.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>In one of his most fascinating essays on <cite>The Main Currents of
Modern Literature</cite>, the Danish critic, Dr. Georg Brandes, discusses
the proper age of feminine Love in a manner which Old Maids will
especially appreciate. He points out that Eleonore, the heroine of
Benjamin Constant’s novel <cite>Adolphe</cite>, is the first specimen of a
modern type subsequently made fashionable by Balzac and George
Sand, namely, <em>the woman of thirty in Love</em>. Formerly, as Jules
Janin remarks, the woman between thirty and forty years of age
was lost for passion, for romance, and the drama; now she rules
alone. The girl of sixteen, as adored by Racine, Shakspere,
Molière, Voltaire, Ariosto, Byron, Lesage, Scott, is no more to be
found. And Mme. Emile de Girardin thus attempts to defend
Balzac: “Is it Balzac’s fault that the age of thirty to-day is the
age of love? Balzac is compelled to depict passion where he finds
it, and at this day it is not to be found in the heart of a girl of
sixteen.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So far as these remarks are true they afford a new confirmation
of my assertions that true Romantic Love is dependent on a certain
amount of intellectual power and maturity, and that in consequence
man loves more deeply than woman at the age preceding
marriage. In England and America novelists still persist in
making women love at any age from eighteen, and they have a
right to do so, because in these two countries women are well
enough educated and experienced in life at eighteen to be able to
love. In France girls receive such a superficial education that
they are ordinarily quite impervious to any deep emotions before
they are either Old Maids or married. But in most cases they are
married before twenty without regard to their own wishes. And
then happens what is indicated in Fuller’s aphorism: “It is to be
feared that they who marry where they do not love, will love
where they do not marry.” And hence it is that the only love
depicted by French novelists and playwrights is the adulterous
love of a faithless wife. Could anything more vividly illustrate
the criminal absurdities of French education and the French system
of chaperonage?</p>

<p class='c001'>In France a girl is not even allowed to cross the street alone
until she is willing to assume the name and with it the comparative
freedom of an Old Maid. In Spain, the author of <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>Cosas de
España</cite></span> tells us, Old Maids are rare because a girl generally
accepts her first offer; and there are probably not many girls who
do not receive at least one offer in their life—masculine women
always excepted. In Russia, where women, according to Schweiger-Lerchenfeld,
enjoy almost as much liberty as in America, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>curious custom prevails by which a girl of uncertain age may
escape the appellation of Old Maid. She may leave home and
become lost for two or three years in Paris, London, or some other
howling wilderness of humanity. Then she may return to her
friends neither as maid nor wife, but as a widow. And it is
“good form” in Russian society to accept this myth without
asking for details.</p>

<p class='c001'>Finally the important question remains: “What is an Old
Maid?” That depends very much on individuals and the care
they take of their Health and Beauty. Some women are Old
Maids at twenty, the majority at thirty, and some not before forty;
while those girls who will read the chapters on Personal Beauty in
the last part of this treatise, and follow all the advice there given,
will never become Old Maids at all, but will be gobbled up before
twenty-three by eager bachelors previously considered hopeless
cases of celibacy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even if it were possible to name a definite age as that when a
girl begins to be an Old Maid, it would be a bit of useless information,
because nobody ever knows how old a woman is. Often it is
easier to tell a woman’s age by her conversation than by her looks:
some incipient Old Maids constantly hint at their former numerous
flirtations, which they never did while they really had them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div><span class='small'>“Pirates of Love who know no duty.”</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Of all the brutes enumerated in the human branch of zoology
the deliberate bachelor is the most unreasonable and selfish. Unreasonable,
because he voluntarily deprives himself of connubial
bliss, domestic comforts, and the prospect of being cheered and
cared for in his old age by a family of loving children. Selfish,
because at present the bread-winning arrangements are almost
entirely framed for man’s convenience alone, wherefore it is his
duty to support a wife.</p>

<p class='c001'>Masculine selfishness, however, is not exclusively responsible for
the rapid increase of bachelordom. The women themselves are
largely at fault—in two ways. The modern tendency of concentrating
population in large cities makes domestic life a much more
expensive affair than it is in smaller towns or in rural districts;
and at the same time women are gradually invading every sphere
of masculine employment, thus reducing wages by competition and
making it more and more difficult for a man to earn an income
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>which allows him to marry. This aspect of the question, once
before alluded to, is one which the advocates of Woman’s Rights
are too apt to ignore. For the benefit of poor young girls, and
widows, and old maids, it is, indeed, but just that various employments
adapted to female hands should be thrown open to them and
properly remunerated; but if the effect of this is simply and constantly
to <em>increase</em> the number of single poor women, by making
marriage impossible, what is gained by the change? A certain
amount of misery is inevitable in the world; and it seems better
that it should be distributed where it will not imperil the popularity
and possibility of marriage.</p>

<p class='c001'>After all, self-supporting women must always be the exception,
not the rule; for it is the destiny of the vast majority of women
to be wives; and regarding these even Mr. Mill admits “it is not
... a desirable custom that the wife should contribute by her
labour to the income of the family.” Now surely it would be most
absurd, as some “strong-minded” women are trying to do, to
arrange the educational scheme of all women so as to benefit the
exceptional women who are excluded from matrimony. A thousand
times more important is it to change woman’s education so as to
enable her to look after her household affairs. It is by neglecting
to do this that women supply the second cause for the increasing
prevalence of Bachelors. Every man is expected to learn his trade
properly before marriage; but woman’s proper occupation—the art
of taking care of home and making it a paradise, is commonly supposed
to be a thing that can be learned easily enough after marriage.
Even when a woman is so wealthy that she is not obliged
to do any housework at all, she should, like a ship’s captain, learn
all about the duties of subordinates, else she will be unable to
command them properly. A captain who displayed ignorance on
any point before his sailors would lose their respect and attitude of
prompt obedience; and it has been suggested that one reason why
American women, especially, have so much trouble with their
servants, is because they know so little about domestic economy
that the servants, ignorant as they are, become arrogant because
of their superior knowledge.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the subject of woman’s sphere, Herbert Spencer has written
words which should be hung in golden letters in every schoolroom:
“When we remember that up from the lowest savagery civilisation
has, among other results, brought about an increasing exemption
of women from bread-winning labour, and in the highest
societies they have become most restricted to domestic duties and the
rearing of children; we may be struck by the anomaly that at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>present time restriction to indoor occupations has come to be
regarded as a grievance, and a claim is made to free competition
with men in all outdoor occupations.... Any extensive change
in the education of women, made with the view of fitting them
for business and professions, would be mischievous. <em>If women
comprehended all that is contained in the domestic sphere, they
would ask no other.</em> If they could see all that is implied in the
right education of children, to a full conception of which no man
has yet risen, much less any woman, they would seek no higher
function” (<cite>Principles of Sociology</cite>, vol. i. § 340).</p>

<p class='c001'>When every woman has learned how to cultivate flowers and
vegetables in her domestic garden at the same time, the millennium
will have arrived, and the word Bachelor be found only in Dictionaries
of Antiquities.</p>

<p class='c001'>Women are sometimes held responsible in still another way for
the continuance of Bachelors in single boredom, viz. by refusing
their Love and breaking their hearts. But surely, as the shepherdess
in <cite>Don Quixote</cite> has so eloquently shown, it does not at all
follow that if a man falls in Love with a woman, she must necessarily
fall in Love with him; and if she does <em>not</em> love him, it is
her <em>duty</em> not to marry him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides, a broken heart is a very rare article in this world, and
every nation has discovered a peculiar local remedy for it: the
Spaniards by stabbing the girl who broke it; the Italians by
annihilating the rival; the Germans by soaking the fragments in
Rhine wine; the Englishmen by a change of air; and ultimately
they all follow the example of the Frenchman who, on the day
following the catastrophe, casts his eyes about for a new charmer;
or, if they do not, but like a snail withdraw into their shell for
the rest of their life, abusing all women as heartless, they are
bigger fools than they look. What would you say of a fisherman
who went out for a day’s sport and returned after an hour because
the first trout that nibbled at the bait escaped?</p>

<p class='c001'>It is the happy privilege of every Bachelor to have loved fully
and deeply once in his life; but if his passion is not appreciated,
it is his duty to try again; for, even as a stolen kiss is not a real
kiss because it lacks the thrill of mutuality, so Love is not Love</p>

<p class='c013'>True, La Rochefoucauld says that “The pleasure of love is

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Yet neither the English poet nor the French essayist appears to
have fathomed the full depth of the problem. It is as incorrect
to say, “the pleasure of love is in loving,” as to say, the pleasure
of Love is in being loved. To be loved by one I do not love is a
matter of complete indifference, except so far as my Pride or Pity
may be involved. To love where I am not loved, or am left in
uncertainty, is more of anguish than of delight. To attain the
highest ecstacy of Love I must both be in Love and able to say at
the same time, “she loves me.” Reciprocity is not only “that
which alone gives stability to love,” as Coleridge remarks, but that
without which consummate Love is impossible.</p>

<p class='c001'>Apparent exceptions occur only when the illusion of being loved
is so vividly kept up by the imagination as to counterfeit reality;
as in the case of Eleonore, who “became so intoxicated with her
Love that she saw it double and mistook her own feeling for that
of both” (Dr. Brandes).</p>

<p class='c001'>Therefore a Bachelor who has been unsuccessful in his first or
second Love has never enjoyed the highest bliss a human soul can
attain, and is bound to try again. Nor need he ever despair.
There are a thousand Juliets in the world for every man, and all
he needs is the good luck to <em>meet</em> the one adapted to him: for she
is his as soon as found; though she may at first have the
“cunning to be strange.”</p>

that there is one thing which excuses celibacy, and may even make

claims that “certainly the best works, and of greatest merit for
the public, have proceeded from the unmarried or childless men.”
A more modern philosopher, Schopenhauer, expresses himself to
the same effect: “For men of higher intellectual avocation, for
poets, philosophers, for all those, in general, who devote themselves
to science and art, celibacy is preferable to married life, because
the conjugal yoke prevents them from creating great works.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The same counsel is indirectly given in Moore’s <cite>Life of Byron</cite>,
where he argues that “In looking back through the lives of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>most illustrious poets—the class of intellect in which the characteristic
features of genius are, perhaps, most strongly marked—we
shall find that with scarcely one exception, from Homer down to
Lord Byron, they have been, in their several degrees, restless and
solitary spirits, with minds wrapped up, like silkworms, in their
own tasks, either strangers or rebels to domestic ties, and bearing
about with them a deposit for posterity in their souls, to the jealous
watching and enriching of which almost all other thoughts and
considerations have been sacrificed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Either strangers or rebels to domestic ties.” Among the
strangers, Moore names Newton, Gassendi, Galileo, Descartes,
Bayle, Locke, Leibnitz, and Hume, to whom may be added Kant,
Schopenhauer, Handel, Beethoven, Schubert, Plato, and many
others.</p>

<p class='c001'>Quite as large is the list of “rebels to domestic ties” among
men of poetic genius. Says Moore: “The coincidence is no
less striking than saddening that, on the list of married poets who
have been unhappy in their homes, there should already be found
four such illustrious names as Dante, Milton, Shakspere, and
Dryden.” “The poet Dante, a wanderer away from wife and
children, passed the whole of a restless life in nursing his immortal
dream of Beatrice.” “The dates of the birth of his [Shakspere’s]
children, compared with that of his removal from Stratford, the
total omission of his wife’s name in the first draft of his will, and
the bitter sarcasm of the bequest by which he remembers her
afterwards—all prove beyond a doubt his separation from the lady
early in life, and his unfriendly feeling towards her at the close.”
“Milton’s first wife, it is well known, ran away from him within
a month after their marriage, ‘disgusted,’ says Phillips, ‘with his
spare diet and hard study,’ and his later domestic misery is universally
known.” “The poet Young, with all his parade of domestic
sorrows, was, it appears, a neglectful husband and a harsh father.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Sir Walter Scott remarks, in his <cite>Life of Dryden</cite>: “The wife
of one who is to gain his livelihood by poetry, or by any labour (if
any there be) equally exhausting, must either have taste enough to
relish her husband’s performances, or good-nature sufficiently to
pardon his infirmities. It was Dryden’s misfortune that Lady
Elizabeth had neither the one nor the other; and I dismiss the
disagreeable subject by observing, that on no one occasion when a
sarcasm against matrimony could be introduced, has our author
failed to season it with such bitterness, as spoke of an inward
consciousness of domestic misery.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Richard Wagner when a young man married an actress, “pretty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>as a picture”; but she appears to have had little sympathy with
his ambitions, so he lived apart from her. Subsequently he was
very happy with Cosima, the daughter of Liszt, who <em>did</em> appreciate
his genius. Liszt himself, after living some years with the
Countess D’Agoult in Italy, separated from her. The girl whom
Haydn married soon turned out a shrew, who had no sympathy
whatever with his musical genius. Berlioz was one of the most
passionate of lovers: “Oh, that I could find her, the Juliet, the
Ophelia that my heart calls to. That I could drink in the intoxication
of that mingled joy and sadness that only true love knows!
Could I but rest in her arms one autumn evening, rocked by the
north wind on some wild heath, and sleeping my last, sad sleep.”
A few years after these rapturous effusions he arranged a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>séparation
à l’aimable</i></span> from his wife, his former flame, and left her to die in
solitude and misery.</p>

<p class='c001'>Handel, after all, was the wisest of the composers. He was
never in Love, and had an aversion to marriage. In 1707 he went
to Lübeck to compete for the place of successor to the famous
organist Buxtehude; but when he found that one of the conditions
of obtaining the place was the compulsory privilege of marrying
the daughter of his predecessor, he got alarmed and fled precipitately.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides the disposition to wrap up their minds, like silkworms,
in their own tasks, Poverty and the extreme difficulty of finding
congenial companions appear to be the principal causes that have
tended to make men of genius strangers or rebels to domestic ties.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is an old saying that if Poverty comes in by one window,
Love goes out by another. But Poverty, unfortunately, seems to
be an almost necessary companion of Genius, at least in the early
stages of its career, till the inertia natural to the human brain has
been overcome. It is so much easier for the richest soils to grow
a luxuriant crop of weeds than a useful crop which needs constant
care, that there can be no doubt that wealth is responsible for the
loss of much Genius to the world. There have been men of genius
in whom the creative impulse was so strong, and the pleasure of
creating so sweet—Goethe, Schopenhauer, Byron, etc.—that they
needed not the goad of hunger; but as a rule a well-filled pocketbook
does not encourage the habit of “infinite painstaking,” which
is essential to Genius. But if a genius marries while he is poor,
he will have to waste his time on rapid, ephemeral work to support
his family; which will leave him neither leisure nor energy for
work of enduring value. Hence he should either not marry at all
or wait till he has an assured income. If money-marriages are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>ever justifiable, they are in such cases; and rich girls should make
it the one object of life to capture a man of Genius, so as to give
him leisure for immortal work. It appears, indeed, as if a sort of
Conjugal Pride of this description were becoming fashionable; for
one hears every month of some author or artist marrying an heiress.
This is certainly the easiest way for a woman to become immortal;
and what is a coquette’s gratified ephemeral vanity, compared with
the proud consciousness of passing down to posterity linked with
an immortal name, and of having helped to make that name immortal
by removing the necessity for bread-winning drudgery!</p>

<p class='c001'>Furthermore, there can be no doubt that the number of persons
able to read a work of genius <em>at sight</em>, as it were, is growing larger
every year. Great men do not have to wait for recognition so
long as formerly, and this enables them to neglect ephemeral
drudgery in favour of creative work.</p>

<p class='c001'>As there has been an unparalleled unfolding and increase in
feminine charms, both of body and mind, within the last half-century,
it is not too optimistic to hope that the other source of
domestic difficulties among men of genius—the extreme difficulty
of finding a congenial companion—will also be removed, in course
of time. Men of genius, as Moore remarks, have such rich resources
of thinking within themselves, that “the society of those less
gifted than themselves becomes often a restraint and burden to
which not all the charms of friendship or even love can reconcile
them.” To be completely happy a Genius should accordingly have
a wife as remarkable among women for the womanly qualities of
receptivity, grace, and sympathy, as he is among men for the manly
quality of creative energy. Yet if it is so difficult for an ordinary
man to meet his ordinary Juliet, how much more so will it ever be
for an extraordinary man to find an extraordinary Juliet!</p>

<p class='c001'>Thanks to their passion for Beauty, men of Genius are too
prone to follow the impulse of the moment and marry a pretty
doll, in the hope of being able to educate her into an attractive
companion. Unluckily it rarely happens that the minds of these
beauties are “wax to receive and marble to retain.” Pretty girls
are commonly lazy—spoiled by the thought that their beauty atones
for everything, and regardless of the future when this apology for
indolence will have lost its persuasiveness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the objections to the celibacy of Genius, the strongest is
supplied by the laws of heredity—the desirability of having their
superior mental qualities—often associated with corresponding
physical beauty—transmitted to the next generation. Genius, it
is true, depends on so many fortuitous circumstances that cases of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>direct transmission from father to son are rare enough; and Mr.
Galton’s researches show that “the ablest child of one gifted pair
is not likely to be as gifted as the ablest of all the children of very
many mediocre pairs;” and that “the more exceptional the gift,
the more exceptional will be the good fortune of a parent who has
a son who equals, and still more if he has a son who overpasses
him.” Nevertheless, it remains true that “the children of a gifted
pair are much more likely to be gifted than the children of a
mediocre pair.” Just as a professor’s son is born with a brain
naturally more plastic and receptive than that of a young savage or
peasant, so the children of a Genius who has not shattered his
health by overwork or dissipation are likely to be of a mental
calibre superior to that of an ordinary professor’s son. So that it
is the duty of a man of genius to get married even at a sacrifice of
personal happiness—provided that sacrifice is not so great as to
interfere with his intellectual duties.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>GENIUS AND LOVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>If we take the word Genius in the Kantian, imaginative, or
æsthetic sense, it may be said that <em>all Geniuses are amorous</em>; and
that the degree of their greatness may as a rule be measured by
their susceptibility to feminine charms. The most poetic part of
the Scriptures is the Song of Solomon with its glowing pictures of
feminine charms. Homer, though he lived long before the age of
Romantic Love, spent his life in describing the mischief caused by
Helen’s beauty. Among the Roman poets the most original was
also the most amorous. As Professor Sellar remarks of Ovid, “In
the most creative periods of English literature he seems to have
been more read than any other ancient poet, not even excepting
Virgil; and it was on the most creative minds, such as those of
Marlowe, Spenser, Shakspere, Milton, and Dryden, that be acted
most powerfully ... and although the spirit of antiquity is better
understood now than it was in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
yet in the capacity of appreciating works of brilliant fancy
we can claim no superiority over the centuries which produced
Spenser, Shakspere, and Milton, nor over those which produced
the great Italian, French, and Flemish painters,” to whom Ovid
supplied such abundant material.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coming to more recent times, we have seen that Dante, the
first modern poet, was also the first modern lover, rarely if ever
surpassed in rapturous adoration. How the greatest of the Spanish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>bards was influenced by feminine beauty may be inferred from the
glowing descriptions of it and its influence in <cite>Don Quixote</cite>; and
as for Shakspere, even had he not written <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>, his
early poems alone would prove him to have been in his youth every
inch a lover; for no one, not even with Shakspere’s imagination,
could have painted such unique feelings with his realistic and
infallible touch, unless he had felt them more than once and had
them indelibly branded on his heart’s memory.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the galaxy of German poets Goethe ranks first, owing to his
manysidedness. Yet he lacked the very highest of literary gifts—wit;
and in this respect as well as through his deeper insight into
Modern Love, Heine must be rated higher than Goethe. Heine’s
personal loves are but thinly covered over by the clear amber of
his lyrics, in which they are imbedded. Goethe’s loves have become
proverbial for their number—Kätchen, Friederike, Lili, Charlotte,
Christiane, etc. Schiller, Wieland, Bürger, Bodenstedt, and the
lesser lights might all have appended a D.L., or Doctor of Love,
to their names.</p>

<p class='c001'>Shelley, Mr. Hamilton tells us, “had an irresistible natural
tendency to fall in love”; and Byron, speaking of one of his loves,
says, “I had and have been attached fifty times since, yet I recollect
all we said to each other, all our caresses, her features, my
restlessness, sleeplessness,” etc. And in the next chapter on
“Genius in Love,” we shall meet with numerous similar cases of
English, German, and French men of genius constantly in Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>To account for this amorous propensity of Genius is easy enough.
Genius means creative power allied with a taste for the Beautiful.
This taste may be gratified by the contemplation of the beauties of
Nature—the creative power by reproducing them on canvas or
manuscript. But Nature’s masterpiece is lovely woman, who not
only yields the highest gratification of artistic taste, but inspires
Love: and what is Love but a creative impulse—a desire to link
one’s name and personality, in future generations, with this embodiment
of consummate human beauty?</p>

<p class='c001'>Shakspere’s</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>suggests another reason why men of Genius are eternally involved
in Love-affairs. The lover becomes infatuated not with the girl he
sees but with the girl he imagines, using her features as a mere
sketch to be filled up <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad libitum</i></span>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“Such tricks hath strong imagination,</div>
      <div class='line'>That if it would but apprehend some joy,</div>
      <div class='line'>It comprehends some bringer of that joy;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or in the night, imagining some fear,</div>
      <div class='line'>How easy is a bush supposed a bear!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>To imagine a feeling is to entertain it; for an imagined impression
revives the same cerebral processes that were aroused by
the original sense impression. In ordinary minds the remembered
image of a girl’s lovely features, the echo of her sweet voice, are
much fainter than the original sight and sound; whereas the
imagination of genius paints a face and recalls a voice as vividly as
if they were present: so that here <em>to think of Love is to be in
Love</em>—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pro tempore</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides his refined taste and vivid imagination—which retouches
every defective negative—it is the natural depth of his emotions
that urges a Genius to fall in Love with every lovely woman.
Passions are like dogs: the big ones need more food than the little
ones. A peasant cannot experience the subtle and multitudinous
emotions that fill the heart of an artist, a statesman, a scientific
discoverer; much less the complex group of ethereal emotions that
make up Romantic Love. The higher we rise in the intellectual
scale, the more varied, complex, and deep are the emotional groups
which delight and torment the soul. As Genius represents the
climax of intellectual power, Love the climax of emotional intensity,
is it wonderful that there should be an affinity between the two?
The higher a mountain peak the more does it attract every passing
cloud and clasp it to its breast—hoping—vainly hoping—to warm
a heart chilled by its isolation above the rest of the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>As men of genius are more prone to love than common sluggish
minds, it is a lucky fact, for the future growth of Romantic Love,
that Genius grows more and more abundant—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pace</i></span> the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>laudatores
temporis acti</i></span> who ignorantly compare the number of living geniuses
with all those that have ever been—as if they had all lived at one
epoch. It may even be granted that there have been epochs that
had more geniuses than we have at present; but of genius there is
more to-day than ever in the world’s history. We see almost daily
in ephemeral periodicals lines and epigrams worthy of the highest
genius, written by men whose names perhaps will never be known.
Shaksperes, indeed, will always tower Mont Blanc-like over all
other peaks; but if summits of the second magnitude seem less
imposing to-day than formerly, it is because the general level of
creativeness has been raised a few thousand feet. The mountains
that enclose the Engadine valley, though 10,000 to 12,000 feet in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>height, seem only half as high, because the valley from which
you see them lies at an altitude of 6000 feet.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>GENIUS IN LOVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Were there not a natural affinity between Genius and Love,
authors and artists would cultivate Love as the source of their
deepest inspiration. For if it makes a temporary poet of every
peasant, what must be its effect in exalting the poet’s inborn
power!</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The Love of men of Genius, as distinguished from that of
ordinary mortals, is characterised by five traits—Precocity, Extravagant
Ardour, Fickleness, Multiplicity, and Fictitiousness—which
must be briefly considered in succession.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>I.—PRECOCITY</h3>

<p class='c013'>Turgenieff makes the narrator of one of his novelettes speak of
his first Love as having been experienced at the age of six. That
this is not a poetic license is abundantly proved by historic facts.
“Dante, we know, was but nine years old,” says Moore, “when,
at a May-day festival, he saw and fell in love with Beatrice; and
Alfieri, who was himself a precocious lover, considers such early
sensibility to be an unerring sign of a soul formed for the fine arts....
Canova used to say that he perfectly well remembered having
been in love when but five years old.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Byron’s first Love was at the age of eight. Concerning this he
wrote at twenty-five: “How the deuce did all this occur so early?
Where could it originate? I certainly had no sexual ideas for
years afterwards; and yet my misery, my love for that girl [Mary
Duff] were so violent that I sometimes wonder if I have ever been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>really attached <a id='corr205.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='since.’'>since.’”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_205.1'><ins class='correction' title='since.’'>since.’”</ins></a></span> Of his second Love-affair Byron says:
“My first dash into poetry was as early as 1800. It was the
ebullition of a passion for my first cousin, Margaret Parker, one of
the most beautiful of evanescent beings. I have long forgotten
the verses, but it would be difficult for me to forget her—her dark
eyes [Byron had a passion for black eyes]—her long eyelashes—her
completely Greek cast of face and figure. I was then about
twelve—she rather older, perhaps a year. She died about a year
or two afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Burns was somewhat older when Love and poetry were born in
his soul simultaneously: “You know our country custom,” he
writes, “of coupling a man and woman together as partners in
the labours of the harvest. In my fifteenth summer my partner
was a bewitching creature, a year younger than myself. My
scarcity of English denies me the power of doing her justice in
that language, but you know the Scottish idiom. She was a
bonnie, sweet, sonsie lass. In short, she, altogether unwittingly
to herself, initiated me in that delicious passion, which, in spite of
acid disappointment, gin-horse prudence, and bookworm philosophy,
I hold to be the first of human joys here below.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Heine’s first boyish love appears to have been a girl who died
as a child, and is alluded to in his <cite>Pictures of Travel</cite> as the
“little Veronica.” His second love was a most extraordinary case
of Love at Sight. It was at a school examination, Robert Proelsz
relates, “and Harry was just declaiming Schiller’s <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Taucher</cite></span>, when
the lovely girl entered the room by the side of her father, who
was one of the inspectors. The boy stuttered, gazed with large
eyes on the beautiful figure, mechanically repeated the verse he
had just recited—‘And the King his lovely daughter beckoned’—and
was unable to proceed. In vain the teacher prompted him,
the poor fellow’s senses failed him, and he fell on the floor in a
swoon.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Of another early visitation of sudden Love he gives an account
in his posthumous memoirs. The girl on this occasion was the
red-haired Sefchen, the sheriff’s daughter, who, when she was only
eight years old, had witnessed the mysterious burial of her grandfather’s
sword, which had done its duty a hundred times, and
which some years later her aunt had dug out and secreted in the
garret. “One day, when we were alone, I begged Sefchen to
show me that curiosity. She willingly complied, went into the
room, and soon came out with an enormous sword, which she
swung vigorously despite her weak arms, while with a roguish,
threatening tone she sang—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“‘Will you kiss the naked sword</div>
      <div class='line'>Which the Lord has given us?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>I replied in the same tone, ‘I will not kiss the naked sword, I will
kiss the red-haired Sefchen;’ and as she could not defend herself,
for fear of hurting me with the fatal steel, she had to let me boldly
put my arms round her slender waist and kiss her defiant lips.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Berlioz had his first passion at twelve, Rousseau at eleven.
“When I saw Mlle. Goton,” writes Rousseau, “I could see
nothing else, all my senses were in confusion.... In her presence
I was agitated, and trembled.... If Mlle. Goton had ordered
me to throw myself into the fire, I believe I would have obeyed
her instantly.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As old age is in many respects a second childhood, it seems
natural that men of genius should appear “precocious” in this
belated sense too. The case of Berlioz is one of the most extraordinary
on record. The girl who was his first love at twelve he
saw again at sixty-one: “I recognised the divine stateliness of her
step; but, oh heavens! how changed she was! her complexion
faded, her hair gray. And yet at the sight of her my heart did
not feel one moment’s indecision; my whole soul went out to its
idol, as though she were still in her dazzling loveliness....
Balzac, nay, Shakspere himself, the great painter of the passions,
never dreamt of such a thing.” And in a letter to her he writes,
“I have loved you, I still love you, I shall always love you. And
yet I am sixty-one years of age.... Oh, madame, madame, I
have but one aim left in the world—that of obtaining your
affection.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Another composer who had a passion at sixty was “Papa”
Haydn—poor Haydn, whose wife led him such a terrible life, and
used his manuscripts for curl-papers. Concerning her he wrote,
“She is always in a bad temper, and does not care whether I am
a shoemaker or an artist.” Indeed, she had never been his true
Love, but was only taken in lieu of her younger sister, whom
Haydn adored, but who refused him and became a nun. At sixty,
however, in London, he had the fortune, or misfortune, to fall in
Love again, with a widow named Schrolter, concerning whom he
wrote, “She was a very attractive woman, and still handsome,
though over sixty; and had I been free I should certainly have
married her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Goethe, in his old days, fell in Love with Minna Herzlieb, a
bookseller’s daughter. “In the sonnets addressed to her,” says
Lewes, “and in the novel of <cite>Elective Affinities</cite>, may be read the
fervour of his passion, and the strength with which he resisted.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Rousseau’s last Love forms one of the most romantic episodes
in his life, concerning which nothing was known until a few years
ago when the French historian, R. Chantslauze, discovered in a
bookstall the MS. of a letter by Rousseau to Lady Cecile Hobart,
dated 1770, when Rousseau was almost sixty years of age. He
appears to have met this lady in England at the time when he was
writing his <cite>Confessions</cite>. She had first won his affection by her
admiration of his works; and in course of his long and hyper-sentimental
letter he remarks, “Why is it that I have never felt
any other true love but that for the products of my own fancy?
Wherein lies the reason, Cecile? In these fancied beings themselves;
they made me dissatisfied with everything else. For forty
years I have carried in my mind the image of her I adore. I love
her with a constancy, an ecstasy inexpressible.... I had no
hope of ever meeting her, had given up the eager search for her,
when you appeared before me. It was folly, infatuation, if you
like, that made me surrender myself for a moment to the magic of
your sight; but I could not but say to myself: There she is!
No other woman ever inspired that thought in me. And stranger
still is it that I could hear you speak without changing my opinion.
What the ideal of my heart thought, you spoke it to my ears.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>II.—ARDOUR</h3>

<p class='c013'>If Bacon did not write the plays of Shakspere, it was the
biggest mistake of his life. Second among his mistakes must
rank the opinion expressed in the following sentence: “You may
observe that amongst all the great and worthy persons (whereof
the memory remaineth, either ancient or modern), there is not one
that hath been transported to the mad degree of love.”</p>

<p class='c001'>If the advocates of the Baconian theory had as much sense of
humour as they stimulate in other people, they would see that
such a sentence—and there are others like it in Bacon—could not
by any possibility have been penned by the author of <cite>As You Like
It</cite>, <cite>Venus and Adonis</cite>, or <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dante was by no means the only “great and worthy person”
before Bacon’s day who had been “transported to the mad degree
of love”; and since Bacon’s day the word Genius has become
almost synonymous with the capacity for lovers’ madness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet there is a grain of truth in Bacon’s sentence as it stands.
He evidently had in mind chiefly the <em>ancient</em> “great and worthy
persons”; and of these, as we have seen, but one or two had even
a vague presentiment of what was to be some day the moral lever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>of the universe. Bacon probably had a dim perception of the fact
that the ancients knew nothing of passionate Love, of the imaginative
type; but he did not quite succeed in grasping the idea.</p>

<p class='c001'>As regards Modern Genius, Bacon’s assertion is so far from the
truth, that it is quite safe to reverse it and say that it is doubtful
whether any one but a man of genius is capable of that intense
ardour of feeling which marks the climax of Love; doubtful
whether even Romeo at his age could have felt a passion such as
Shakspere’s glowing imagination painted. Love is based, not on
what a man sees with his eyes, but on the mental image retouched
by the imagination; and a man of genius, being a <em>virtuoso of the
imagination</em>, can adorn his ideal of love with ornaments unknown
to ordinary mortals; whence it follows that the passion inspired
by his more vivid and beautiful image must be more intense than
the passion inspired by less perfect visions in common, sluggish
brains. And since artistic thought can no more crystallise into
verse or epigram without the warm glow of emotion than a flower
can grow into a thing of beauty without its daily bath of warm
sunshine, it is fortunate that Genius implies a natural susceptibility
to the æsthetic passion of Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fortunate also for the prospects of Romantic Love is the fact
that Genius is king in its realms. Had not the sacred mysteries
of Love been revealed to the world in the glowing language of
poetry, it would probably have remained a thing unknown to
ordinary mortals for centuries to come; even as the beauties of
Nature, for which common minds have no eyes, would have
remained undetected, had not the poets and artists disclosed the
bonds that connect them with human sympathies.</p>

<p class='c001'>As all the quotations from poets given in this chapter (and in
that on Hyperbole) practically bear witness to the exceptional
ardour of Love in men of genius, only two cases need be cited as
specimens—those of Burns and Heine. Gilbert Burns, the brother
of the poet, writes that the latter “was constantly the victim of
some fair enslaver. The symptoms of his passion were often such
as nearly to equal those of the celebrated Sappho. I never,
indeed, knew that he ‘fainted, sunk, and died away’; but the
agitations of his mind and body exceeded anything of the kind I
ever knew in real life.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Heine has given evidence in his letters as well as his poems
that few even of his equals have ever felt the power of love so
profoundly. It is well to emphasise this fact; for there are not a
few who fancy that, like Petrarch, Heine embodied in his songs
not the real feelings of his heart but fictitious emotions depicted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>to gratify poetic ambition. He did no such thing. His Love-poetry
is the echo of real passion, of his first and only true Love,
which cast a shadow over his whole life, and goaded him into
bitter reflections more than a decade after its sad ending. He
loved his cousin Molly, and writes to a friend, after an absence
from home: “Rejoice with me! rejoice with me! in four weeks I
shall see Molly. With her my muse will also return.” The
muse did return, but in a different way from that which he had
anticipated; with a smile in her face of cynicism, mockery,
melancholy, which never again left her. “She loves me <em>not</em>!” he
writes, in 1816. “Softly, dear Christian, pronounce that last
word softly. In the first words lies the eternal living heaven, but
in the last lies eternal living hell. If you could only see your
friend’s countenance, how pale he looks, how bewildered, how
insane, your righteous indignation at my long silence would vanish
soon; better still were it if you could have one glance at my soul—then
would you really learn to love me.” “I have seen her again—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘The devil take my soul,</div>
      <div class='line'>My body be the sheriff’s,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet I for me alone</div>
      <div class='line'>Select the loveliest woman.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Hui! do you not shudder, Christian! Well may you shudder
even as I do. Burn the letter, the Lord have mercy on my soul.
I did not write these words. There on my chair sits a pale man;
he wrote them. And this because it is midnight. Oh heavens!
Madness cannot sin!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There, there, do not breathe so heavily, there I have just
built a lovely card-house, and on the top of it I stand and hold
her in my arms!... But indeed you can hardly fancy, dear
Christian, how delightful, how lovely my ruin appears. Far from
her, to carry burning desires in my heart for years, is torture
infernal; but to be near her and yet oft sigh in vain, whole endless
weeks, for my only delight, the sight of her and—and—O!
O! O! Christian! that is enough to make the purest, most pious
soul flare up in wild, delirious ungodliness!”</p>

<p class='c001'>And the object of this passion, who might have saved a poet’s
soul and changed him from a negative ferment into a positive
agent of culture? She was the daughter of a millionaire, who, of
course, in German fashion, had to marry into another rich family.
To marry a poor poet would have been deemed a terrible <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>mésalliance</i></span>.
Yet was he not a millionaire too—of ideas, as she was in
beauty, her father in money? But that is reasoning <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>à la</i></span> Millennium.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>What a comedy it will be to future generations, entirely
emancipated from mediæval puerilities, to read that two such
<em>Kings</em> in the realm of Genius as Schubert and Beethoven, could
not marry their true loves on account of differences in social
position—rank and money!</p>

<p class='c001'>We are accustomed to look down on China and Chinese culture.
But China anticipated Europe by several centuries in the discovery
of gunpowder; and there is another thing in which that country
is centuries ahead of Europe. “In China there is no aristocracy
of birth or money. The aristocracy which here ranks socially
above the other classes is solely and only that of the <em>Intellect</em>.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>III.—FICKLENESS</h3>

<p class='c013'>Love is a tissue of paradoxes. The very ardour of their
passion inclines men of genius to fickleness. “Love me little love
me long” is a short way of saying that whereas a blazing, roaring
fire consumes itself in an hour, the quiet, glowing coals covered
with ashes will outlast the night.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lamartine’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“heureuse la beauté que le poète adore”</span>—happy
the beauty whom the poet adores—may be endorsed by a maiden
who is willing to become the secondary wife of a poetic polygamist
already wedded to a muse, for the sake of having it said in his
biography that she inspired him with some of his prettiest conceits—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Cynthia, facundi carmen juvenile Properti,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Accepit famam nec minus ilia dedit,”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>as Martial says of a Roman beauty. Others will hesitate on
reading the following, from <cite>London Society</cite>:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lord Byron has said that nothing can inflict greater torture
upon a woman than the mere fact of loving a poet; and though
Lamartine calls it a glory to be the object of immortal songs, we
half-suspect that the English bard is right, and that it would be
impossible to describe the moral sufferings of those frail beings
who seem to be the mere toys of an hour. The world may be
indebted to them for some great poem which their love has had
the power to inspire, but they themselves were probably no more
thought of by the poet than the daisy he might tread on as he
passed by.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here is a case in point: “Swift,” says Byron, “when neither
young nor handsome, nor rich nor even amiable, inspired two of
the most extraordinary passions on record—Vanessa’s and Stella’s....
He requited them bitterly, for he seems to have broken the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>heart of the one and worn out that of the other; and he had his
reward, for he died a solitary idiot in the hands of servants.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It would be unjust, however, in all cases to trace poetic fickleness
to heartless or deliberate cruelty. May not the poet and the
artist be regarded as martyrs to art and science—students of
beauty, obliged to take a purely æsthetic, <em>disinterested interest</em> in
feminine charms—as they do in a picture or a landscape—without
any desire of exclusive possession? They flirt, apparently, not to
break hearts, but merely to educate their sense of beauty. For is
not a woman’s face the compendium of all beauty in the world?
and a woman’s eyes, expressing incipient Love, are they not so
exquisitely beautiful that an epicure of Love could for ever be
contented with that expression alone, feeling that marriage, which
might alter it, if ever so little, would be a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bétise</i></span>? Perhaps some
similar thought was in Heine’s mind when he wrote his famous</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">"Du bist wie eine Blume</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">So hold und schön und rein;</span></div>

      <div class='line'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">So rein und schön und hold.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In quite a different kind of a poem Heine bluntly announces to
his “Queen Mary IV.” his declaration of independence, and
informs her that not a few who ruled before her have been
unceremoniously deposed—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Manche die vor dir regierte</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>And in his narrative of the sheriff’s daughter he says, “I shall not
describe my love for Josepha in detail. This, however, I will confess,
that it was after all only a prelude to the great tragedies of
my riper years. Thus does Romeo become infatuated with Rosaline
before he finds his Juliet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Byron’s confession, in speaking of an early love, that he had
been “attached fifty times since” has been referred to already;
and although Byron loved to exaggerate his foibles, his record in
this case does not belie his words. Of Burns, Principal Shairp
writes that “There was not a comely girl in Tarbolton on whom
he did not compose a song, and then he made one which included
them all.” Burns himself confesses, “In my conscience, I believe
that my heart has been so often on fire that it has been vitrified.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>And Washington Irving remarks on Goldsmith’s first love as “a
passion of that transient kind which grows up in idleness and
exhales itself in poetry.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Of this kind were two passions of Lamb, concerning which a
biographer says, “A youthful passion, which lasted only a few
months, and which he afterwards attempted to regard lightly as a
folly past, inspired a few sonnets of very delicate feeling and
exquisite music.” And of his second flame, “His stay at Pentonville
is remarkable for the fugitive passion conceived by Lamb for
a young Quakeress named Hester Savory, which he has enshrined
and immortalised in the little poem of <cite>Hester</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Goethe has the reputation of having been of all famous lovers
the most fickle. Like Byron, Goethe appears to have endeavoured
to make himself appear more frivolous than he was. His amorous
Roman <cite>Elegies</cite>, which have given so much offence, were in reality
written in Thuringia, after his return from Italy; and their heroine
was no one but the girl who subsequently became his wife.</p>

<p class='c001'>It remained for a Scotchman to write the best apology for
Goethe’s love-affairs. “To Goethe,” says Professor Blackie, “the
sight of any beautiful object was like delicate music to the ear of
a cunning musician; he was carried away by it, and floated in its
element joyously, as a swallow in the summer air, or a sea-mew on
the buoyant wave. Hence the rich story of Goethe’s loves, with
which scandal, of course, and prudery have made their market,
but which, when looked into carefully, were just as much part of
his genius as <cite>Faust</cite> or <cite>Iphigenia</cite>—a part, indeed, without which
neither <cite>Faust</cite> nor <cite>Iphigenia</cite> could have been written.... Let no
one, therefore, take offence when I say that Goethe was always
falling in love, and that I consider this a great virtue in his
character.”</p>

<p class='c001'>One more case: “Beethoven constantly had his love-affairs,”
says Wegeler. His first love was a Cologne beauty, who coquetted
with him and another man till both discovered she was engaged
to a <em>third</em>! Several times Beethoven made up his mind to marry;
he made two definite proposals, both of which were refused. One
fatal objection was his habit of falling in love with women above
him in “rank.” “It is a frightful thing,” he once wrote, “to
make the acquaintance of such a sweet creature and to lose her
immediately; and nothing is more insupportable than thus to have
to confess one’s own foolishness.” One of his flames, an opera
singer, gave as a reason why she refused him that he was “so ugly
and half-cracked!”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>IV.—MULTIPLICITY</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps the most unique trait in the love of men of genius is
the apparent occasional absence of the element of Monopoly. It
was Ovid who first discussed the question whether a man could
love two women at once. His friend Græcinus denied the possibility
of such a thing; but in one of his <cite>Elegies</cite> Ovid refutes him
by citing his own case of a double simultaneous infatuation. He
hesitates which of the two to choose, chides Venus for torturing
him with double love—for adding leaves to the trees, stars to the
heavens, water to the ocean.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of modern authors not a few appear to have followed in
Ovid’s footsteps. We have seen how madly Heine was in love
for a long time with his cousin Amalie. Yet, as one of his biographers,
Robert Proelsz, remarks, this ardent though hopeless
infatuation saved him neither at Hamburg nor at Bonn, nor at
Hanover or Berlin, from a number of love-affairs, some of which
are vaguely commemorated in his writings. Another German
poet, Wieland, after various romantic adventures, fell in love with
Julia Bondeli, a pupil of Rousseau’s, and asked for her heart and
hand; but she mistrusted him, and asked the pertinent question,
“Tell me, will you never be able to love another besides me?”
“Never!” he replied, “that is impossible.... Yet it might be
possible for a moment, if I should chance to see a more beautiful
woman than you who is at the same time very unhappy and very
virtuous.” “Poor Wieland,” Scherr continues, “who subsequently
understood the anatomy of the female heart so well, appears not
to have known then that <em>no</em> woman pardons in her lover the
thought that he might find another more beautiful than her. Julia
knew what she had to do, and with deeply-wounded heart allowed
the poet to depart.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Of Burns his brother Gilbert says, “When he selected any one
out of the sovereignty of his good pleasure, to whom he should pay
his particular attention, she was instantly invested with a sufficient
stock of charms out of the plentiful stores of his own imagination;
and there was often a great disparity between his fair captivator
and her attributes. One generally reigned paramount in his
affections; but as Yorick’s affections flowed out toward Madame
de L—— at the remise door, while the eternal vows of Eliza
were upon him, so Robert was frequently encountering other
attractions, which formed <em>so many under-plots in the drama of
his love</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In Goethe’s life these “under-plots” played a like prominent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>part. “He always needed a number of feminine hearts of more or
less personal interest, in which to mirror himself,” we read; and
he himself told his Charlotte (in 1777) that her love was “the
thread by which all his other little passions, pastimes, and flirtations
hung.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So that, after all, it seems possible to love two at a time; but
it <em>takes genius to do it</em>!</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet even with men of genius it is only possible in ordinary
love-affairs. A supreme love-affair allows but one goddess under
any circumstances.</p>

<p class='c001'>Schumann was one of the most multitudinous lovers on record.
Apparently his first love was Nanni, his “guardian angel,” who
saved him from the perils of the world, and hovered before his
vision like a saint. “I feel that I could kneel before her and
adore her like a Madonna,” he says in a letter. But Nanni had a
dangerous rival in Liddy. Not long, however, for he found Liddy
silly, cold as marble, and—fatal defect! she could not sympathise
with him regarding Jean Paul. “The exalted image of my ideal
disappears when I think of the remarks she made about Jean
Paul. Let the dead rest in peace.” Curiously enough, there are
references to both these girls at various dates, showing that, like
Ovid, he vacillated between the two. He had a number of other
flames, and after his engagement to Clara Wieck gave her warning
that he had the “very mischievous habit” of being a great admirer
of lovely women. “They make me positively smirk, and I
swim in panegyrics on your sex. Consequently, if at some future
time we walk along the streets of Vienna and meet a beauty, and
I exclaim, ‘Oh Clara! see this heavenly vision!’ or something of
the sort, you must not be alarmed nor scold me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But the most enterprising lover ever known to the world was
Alfieri; for his first Love seems to have <em>embraced a whole female
seminary</em>! In his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Mémoires</cite></span>, at any rate, he uses the plural in
speaking of the object of his first passion. He was indeed only
nine years old, which may excuse this amorous anomaly. He had
seen in church a number of young novices, and thus describes his
feelings (the italics are mine): “My innocent attraction towards
<em>these</em> novices became so strong that I thought of them and their
doings incessantly. At one moment my imagination painted <em>them</em>
holding their candles in their hands, serving mass with an air of
angelic submission, and again raising the smoke of incense at the
foot of the altar; and, entirely absorbed in these images, I
neglected my studies; every occupation and all companionship
bored me.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>V.—FICTITIOUSNESS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>If Shakspere could identify woman with frailty, one might with
equal propriety exclaim, Vanity, thy name is man! Clever men
have a habit of paying pretty girls neat compliments, less to please
the girls than to show off their wit. And clever women, though
they may not accept these remarks literally, still have cause to be
gratified with them, in proportion to the excellence of the wit; for
ugliness or inferior beauty never inspires a happy thought in a
clever man.</p>

<p class='c001'>Poets represent the climax of masculine vanity. Though their
first Love-poems may be the embodiment of real passion, in subsequent
efforts the purely literary origin is too often apparent. Since
poetic composition is in itself a mingled agony and delight, very
like Love itself, nothing so facilitates its progress as exciting Love-memories.
Hence poets are for ever urged on to compose Love
ditties in which they endeavour to out-Romeo Romeo, to out-hyperbolise
one another, as women try to out-dress one another.
This is one aspect of their vanity; the other lies in their desire
for sympathetic admiration. So, whenever a poet meets a damsel
who comes within half a mile of his ideal, he forthwith unfolds
before her eyes his gaudy dithyrambs and sonnets, and indulges
in various Love-antics, very much like an infatuated peacock.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even the great Dante is not free from the reproach of having
used his true love for mere literary purposes. Beatrice became to
him gradually an abstraction, an allegory, a name for woman in
general. But it is in his countryman Petrarch that the tendency
to use a sweetheart for purely ornamental purposes, as if she were
a feather to be stuck in one’s hat, is most vividly illustrated.
Petrarch is a conspicuous illustration of the fact that a poetic
reputation once established will live on for ever, for the simple
reason that very few people ever take the trouble to read and
judge for themselves; so that an undeserved reputation, like a
disease, is inherited by generation after generation.</p>

<p class='c001'>No one, of course, can question Petrarch’s learning and his
influence on the progress of modern culture. I speak of him only
as a love-poet; and as such he occupies a wofully low rank. I
have read and reread his sonnets, and have found them one of the
dreariest deserts the quest for information has ever driven me into.
To say with Mr. Symonds, in the <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>, that
“he was far from approaching the analysis of emotion with the
directness of a Heine or De Musset,” is putting it very mildly indeed.
Professor Scherr points out his lack of poetic imagination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>in these words: “Though he took so much trouble to hand down
the beauty of his Laura to posterity, yet (he) never gets beyond
a tedious enumeration of her charms. Petrarch never gives us a
clear portrait of his lady.” “The poems of her lover,” says Mr.
Symonds, “demonstrate that she was a <em>married woman</em>, with
whom he enjoyed a respectful and not very intimate friendship.”
Moore refers to Petrarch as one “who would not suffer his only
daughter to reside beneath his roof, [but] expended thirty-two
years of poetry and passion on an idealised love.” Schopenhauer
naïvely accepted the reality of Petrarch’s passion, which the poor
fellow had to drag through life “like a prisoner’s chain,” because
the case suited his argument; but Mr. Macaulay more justly remarks
that “to readers of our time, the love of Petrarch seems to
have been of that kind which breaks no hearts.” Finally Professor
Scherr’s opinion may be cited, which agrees with the view here taken.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1327 Petrarch “made the acquaintance of Laura, the wife
of Hugo de Sade, who has become famous through him, and whom
during twenty-one years he continued to love, or at least to celebrate
in song; for one feels somewhat uncertain regarding this
love, and is very much tempted to regard it more as a matter of
the head than of the heart and the senses—more as a welcome
theme for his troubadour art and Provençal amorous subtlety than
as a genuine, true passion. Petrarch’s qualities in general, both
as a man and as a poet, are tainted by an appearance of hollowness,
a want of substance and character. He lacked genuine originality,
the power of spontaneous creation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Petrarch, it is true, was an extreme case of the poet’s inclination
to give Love a fictitious permanence and depth; and he lived, moreover,
at a time when the novelty of the spiritual aspect of Love
naturally inclined the mind to exaggeration in that direction. In
the case of modern poets, much less allowance has to be commonly
made for motives of purely poetic or literary origin.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such being the leading characteristics of Love in men of genius,
and such men being emotionally a few centuries ahead of others,
the questions arise, “Is it likely that the Love of ordinary mortals
will gradually assume those traits? and is it desirable that it should?”</p>

<p class='c001'>There seems no immediate danger that the world will be
peopled largely by geniuses, though there is a rapid and steady
advance in culture, which in a thousand years may greatly lessen
the difference between men of genius and average men of the future
as compared with those of to-day. When that millennium arrives
the man of genius may have advanced another step, but not so
great, perhaps, as that which now raises him above the common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>herd. He will not then be so great an anomaly, and will find
society less willing than in the past to make allowance for his
irregularities, such as his fickleness and multiplicity of Love-affairs.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet, after all, these great men are only partly to blame for
their fickleness. Beethoven once boasted of having loved one
woman for <em>seven months</em> as something unusual. But had Beethoven
been so fortunate as to meet and marry a woman having those
qualities which Sir Walter Scott says the wife of a genius should
have—either “taste enough to relish her husband’s performances,
or good nature enough to pardon his infirmities,”—he might have
been blessed with a love not of seven months, but of seven times
seven years. Of Shelley, Mr. Symonds tells us that, “In his own
words, he had loved Antigone before he visited this earth: and no
one woman could probably have made him happy, because he was
for ever demanding more from love than it can give in the mixed
circumstances of mortal life.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Galton, who has made such a careful study of the phenomena
of genius and marriage (<cite>Hereditary Genius</cite>), remarks on the
“great fact ... that able men take pleasure in the society of
intelligent women, and, if they can find such as would in other
respects be suitable, they will marry them in preference to mediocrities.”
Unfortunately, as before dwelt on, great beauty and
great intellect, or amiability, do not always coincide, owing to the
fact that pretty girls do not feel the necessity of cultivating their
minds. But in men of genius their own store of intellect is so great,
and their admiration for Beauty so intense, that they are constantly
liable to marry silly girls; or before marriage to flirt with one
beauty after another without finding satisfaction. In a few generations,
however, there will doubtless be many more women than
now or in the past who will be intelligent, amiable, and beautiful
at the same time; and such women will be able to fetter even the
erratic love of geniuses with adamantine chains, impervious to rust
and alteration, and thus cure them of their Fickleness and their
constant effort to love more than one at a time.</p>

<p class='c001'>Poetic Fictitiousness, of course, is a trait which does no one any
harm, and often enriches literature with charming fancies. And
as for the two remaining characters of genius-Love—Ardour and
Precocity—it is evident that there cannot be too much of them in
the world. The dawn of Love is always the dawn of so much
refinement of the soul, the awakening of so much ambition, that it
cannot be too precocious; and the more ardent it is the more
thoroughgoing will be its results. Nor need a big fire go out
sooner than a small one, provided there is a constant supply of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>fresh fuel—a point which Balzac has discussed with much eloquence
in his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Physiologie du Mariage</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coleridge says “It is the business of virtue to give a feeling
and a passion to our purer intellect, and to intellectualise our
feelings and passions.” Now this is precisely what is done by
Romantic Love, which first originated in the minds of men of
genius.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The might of one fair face sublimes my love,</div>
      <div class='line'>For it hath weaned my heart from low desires.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“Sublimes my love.” These three words of Michael Angelo contain
the whole philosophy of our subject. And what is it that
sublimes Love chiefly? “The might of one fair face”—the magic
effect of Personal Beauty. Perhaps, after all, the greatest difference
between the Love of a genius and an ordinary mortal is that
in the former the æsthetic element—the Admiration of Beauty—is
so much stronger, making up two-thirds of the whole passion.
And as a taste for the beautiful in art and nature becomes more
common, the Love of common mortals, in approaching that of
genius, will more and more partake of this æsthetic refinement—this
worship of Personal Beauty for the sake of the higher gratifications
it yields to the imagination.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>INSANITY AND LOVE</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>ANALOGIES</h3>

<p class='c013'>The poets, who have in all ages insisted on the analogies between
genius and insanity, have also long since discovered a
general resemblance between Love and Insanity. Indeed, the
notion that Love is a sort of madness is as old as Plato. Love,
as understood by him—that is, man’s “worship of youthful masculine
beauty”—is, he says, mad, irrational, superseding reason
and prudence in the individual mind. And the Stoics, who regarded
all affections as maladies, looked upon the severest of the
passions as a grave mental disease.</p>

<p class='c001'>Modern poetry is full of allusions to the fatuous folly of Love.
Thus Thomson—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A lover is the very fool of nature.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Shakspere—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in7'>“The lunatic, the lover, and the poet</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Are of imagination all compact.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>That they behold and see not what they see?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>And the mischievous Rosalind informs us that “Love is merely a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>madness, and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip
as madmen do; and the reason why they are not so punished and
cured is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in
love too.”</p>

<p class='c001'>All this is mere poetic banter; but there is a substratum of
truth which the poets must have dimly felt. Modern alienists do
not treat their patients to dark rooms and whips, as their predecessors
did. They regard the maladies of their patients as brain
diseases, which have been studied and classified, and are treated on
general hygienic and therapeutic principles. A comparison of the
classifications adopted in psychiatry with the symptoms of Love
shows that Insanity and Love resemble each other especially in three
common traits,—the presence of Illusions, a sort of Delirium of
Persecution, and the Desire for Solitude.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are two ways in which madmen people the outside world
with phantoms of their own imaginations—by means of illusions
and of hallucinations.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hallucinations are pure figments of the imagination, without
any object corresponding to them or suggesting them in the outer
world. A patient suffering from them will stare into vacancy and
see a friend, or perhaps the devil with horns, tail, and hoofs; and
he sees him as vividly as if he were really there to be touched;
the reason being that in that part of the brain where impressions
of sight are localised a diseased action is set up which suggests a
picture that is forthwith projected into outward space—as usual
with all sense-impressions. In a word, the patient paints the devil
in his mind’s eye, and there he is.</p>

<p class='c001'>Illusions, on the other hand, have real external objects for their
cause; but the diseased imagination so falsifies the objects that
there is little or no resemblance between the mental vision and
the outside reality. A patient suffering from illusions sees a candle
and thinks it is the sun, hears a footstep and thinks it thunder.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is not this precisely what Shakspere chides Cupid for—that he
makes our eyes “behold and see not what they see?” or makes
them “see Helen’s beauty in a brow of Egypt?” Concerning
Burns we have just read that “there was often a great disparity
between his fair captivator and her attributes”—that is, the attributes
with which she was invested by her lover.</p>

<p class='c001'>The lover, like the lunatic, has had moments when, “beholding
his maiden, he half-knows she is not that which he worships”;
but such intervals are rare. Take a madman who believes his
body is made of glass, and throw him downstairs: none the less
will he believe in his vitreous constitution. Show a lover the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>most beautiful woman in the world, still will he believe his own
Dulcinea a hundred times more charming.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is, in the second place, a very common form of insanity,
called the Delirium of Persecution. The sufferer imagines that
everybody he passes notices him, suspects him of something, or
even intends him some harm. Dr. Hammond speaks of a patient
of this class “who was sure that all the clergymen had entered
into a conspiracy to ‘pray him into hell’! He went to the
churches to hear what they had to say, and discovered adroit
allusions to himself, and hidden invocations to God for his eternal
damnation, in the most harmless and platitudinous expressions.
He wrote letters to various pastors of churches, denouncing them
for their uncharitable conduct toward him, and threatening them
with bodily damage if they persisted in their efforts to secure the
destruction of his soul.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Quand nous aimons,”</span> says Pascal, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“nous nous imaginons que
tout le monde s’en aperçoit”</span>—when we are in love we imagine
that everybody perceives it. The lover feels so awkward and
embarrassed that he thinks every one about him must discover his
secret; and this constant apprehension doubles his awkwardness,
and in most cases does lead to his detection. And the jealous
lover to whom “trifles light as air” are confirmations of infidelity,
who sees dangerous rivalry in the most superficial attentions, and
inconstancy in the most harmless smile she bestows on another—how
does he differ from the man who thought the clergy were
trying to pray him into hell, except that in the one case the disordered
imagination is more easily restored to its normal functions
than in the other?</p>

<p class='c001'>Thirdly, the lunatic and the lover, in their melancholy stages,
have a common fondness for Solitude. For days and weeks
a patient will sit motionless, indifferent to everybody and everything
in the world except the one idea that has fixed on his brain
like a leech, and is sucking its life-blood. Nothing, says an
observer, is so noticeable on visiting an asylum where the patients
are allowed some liberty, as the way in which each one seeks
a solitary place regardless of his fellows.</p>

<p class='c001'>Are not, in the same way—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Fountain-heads and pathless groves</div>
      <div class='line'>Places which pale passion loves?”—<span class='sc'>Fletcher.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But what madman in his wildest flights ever conceived anything
quite so sublimely solitary as the flight which Burns projected for
himself and Clarinda (in lovers’ arithmetic twice one are one) in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>the following epistle: "Imagine ... that we were set free from
the laws of gravitation which bind us to this globe, and could at
pleasure fly, without inconvenience, through all the yet unconjectured
bounds of creation, what a life of bliss would we lead, in our
mutual pursuit of virtue and knowledge, and our mutual enjoyment
of love and friendship!</p>

<p class='c001'>“I see you laughing at my fairy fancies, and calling me a
voluptuous Mahometan; but I am certain I would be a happy
creature beyond anything we call bliss here below; nay, it would
be a paradise congenial to you too. Don’t you see us, hand in
hand, or rather, my arm about your lovely waist, making our
remarks on Sirius, the nearest of the fixed stars; or, surveying a
comet flaming innoxious by us, as we just now would mark
the passing pomp of a travelling monarch; or, in a shady bower of
Mercury or Venus, dedicating the hour to love, in mutual converse,
relying honour, and revelling endearment, while the most exalted
strains of poesy and harmony would be the ready, spontaneous
language of our souls.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus we have in the madman’s Illusions an analogy with Love’s
Hyperbolising tendency; in the Delirium of Persecution a suggestion
of Jealousy; in the Desire for Solitude a reminder of Love’s
Exclusiveness, and desire to be cast on a desert island.</p>

<p class='c001'>Gallantry, again, has in the past frequently assumed an extravagant
form bordering on madness. Thus, with reference to
a Greek girl to whom Byron made love in Athens, Moore says,
“It was, if I recollect right, in making love to one of these girls
that he had recourse to an act of courtship often practised in that
country—namely, giving himself a wound across the breast with
his dagger. The young Athenian, by his own account, looked on
very coolly during the operation, considering it a fit tribute to her
beauty, but in no wise moved to gratitude.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In Spain, toward the beginning of the last century, Gallantry
appears to have assumed a form of mad extravagance. As Mme.
d’Aunoy relates in her <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Mémoires sur l’Espagne</cite></span>, no man who
accompanied a lady was so rude as to give her his hand or to take
her arm under his. He only wrapped his cloak around his arm,
and then allowed her to rest her arm on the elbow. Nor was even
a lover permitted to kiss his love or caress her otherwise than by
tenderly grasping her arm with his hands.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of mediæval lovers’ madness cases have been cited elsewhere,
showing to what crazy excess the Knight-errants and Troubadours
sometimes carried their gallant devotion. One more amusing
illustration may here be added: the oft-cited cases of Peire Vidal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>a Troubadour of the twelfth century, who, to please his beloved,
whose name was Loba (wolf), had himself sewed up in a wolf’s
hide and went about the mountains howling until his man&oelig;uvres
were brought to a sad end by some shepherd dogs, who, having no
sense of humour, gave him such a shaking that he was only too
glad to resume his normal attitude.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is, in fact, hardly a feature of Love which, in its exalted
manifestations, does not occasionally suggest a madhouse. The
extravagant Pride shown by a commonplace man in his more commonplace
bride, is quite as ludicrous as a lunatic’s delusion that he
is a millionaire or emperor of the five continents. The sham
capture of a bride still practised among many nations when all
parties are willing, illustrates a form of Coyness which would appear
as pure lunacy to one unfamiliar with the origin of that custom.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>EROTOMANIA, OR REAL LOVE-SICKNESS</h3>

<p class='c013'>Besides these general analogies there is a form of mental disease
which is genuine love-sickness, the outcome of brain disease, and
which often seems, for all the world, like a deliberate caricature of
Coquetry.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It often happens,” says Dr. Hammond, “that the subjects of
emotional monomania of the variety under consideration do not
restrict their love to any one person. They adore the whole male
sex, and will make advances to any man with whom they are
brought into even the slightest association. If confined in an
asylum they simper and clasp their hands, and roll their eyes to
the attendants, especially the physicians, and even the male
patients are not below their affections. There is very little
constancy in their love. They change from one man to another
with the utmost facility and upon the slightest pretext. ‘I am
very much in love with Dr. ——,’ said a woman to me in an
asylum that I was visiting, ‘but he was late yesterday in coming
to the ward, and now I love you. You will come often to see me,
won’t you?’ While she was speaking the superintendent entered
the ward. ‘Oh, here comes my first and only love!’ she exclaimed.
’Why have you stayed away so long from your
Eliza?‘”</p>

<p class='c001'>Professor von Krafft-Ebing, in his admirable <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Lehrbuch der
Psychiatrie</cite></span>, thus characterises Erotomania in general: "The
kernel of the whole matter is the delusion of being singled out and
loved by a person of the other sex, who regularly belongs to a
higher social sphere. And it deserves to be noted that the love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>felt by the patient towards this person is a romantic, ecstatic, but
entirely ‘Platonic’ affection. In this respect these patients remind
one of the knight-errants and minstrels of bygone times, whom
Cervantes has so incisively lashed in his <cite>Don Quixote</cite>....</p>

<p class='c001'>"From the looks and gestures of the beloved individual they
draw the inference that they in return are not regarded with indifference.
With astonishing rapidity they lose their self-possession.
The most harmless incidents are regarded by them as signs of love,
and an encouragement to draw near. Even newspaper advertisements
relating to others are supposed to come from the person in
question. Finally, hallucinations make their appearance, by the
aid of which the patients begin to be conversant with the object of
their love. Illusions also supervene; in the conversations of others
the patient fancies he hears references to his love-affairs. He feels
happy, exalted in his estimate of himself....</p>

<p class='c001'>“At last the patient compromises himself by acting in consonance
with his delusion, thus making himself ridiculous and
impossible in society, and necessitating his confinement in an
asylum.”</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE LANGUAGE OF LOVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The insane freaks of erotomaniacs, and the analogous, ludicrous
exaggerations in the expression and conduct of lovers, may be
regarded as the pathologic and the comic sides of Love’s Language.</p>

<p class='c001'>Normally, Romantic Love has no fewer than three languages:—Words,
Facial Expression, and Caresses, including Kisses. It will
at once be seen that this classification involves a crescendo &lt;, from
the weakest form of expression to its climax in kissing. Kissing,
indeed, though it comes under the head of Caresses, is of so much
significance that it may be regarded, if not as a separate language
of Love, at least as a special dialect—perhaps the long-sought
world-language intelligible to all?</p>

<h3 class='c014'>I.—WORDS</h3>

<p class='c013'>Though the greatest poets have striven to become virtuosi in
the art of expressing Love in written language, yet words are the
weakest and least trustworthy mode of expressing the amorous
emotions. Least trustworthy, because the male flatterer, as well
as the female coquette, constantly use language to conceal their
thoughts and real emotions. Weakest, because words are less
eloquent even than silence. For—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>“They that are rich in words must needs discover</div>
      <div class='line'>They are but poor in that which makes a lover;”</div>

  </div>

<p class='c018'>And</p>

      <div class='line'>Than words though ne’er so witty.”—<span class='sc'>Raleigh.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Cordelia’s love was deeper than that of her sisters—too deep to
be expressed in formal words. And King Lear scorned her and
favoured her sisters; even as shallow maidens constantly look down
on silent, awkward adorers of deep affections, and throw themselves
away on shallow, fickle, loquacious Lotharios, because they do not
understand the real Language of Love, which, according to a stupid
old myth, every woman is supposed to know by intuition or
instinct.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>II.-FACIAL EXPRESSION,</h3>

<p class='c018'>although more trustworthy than written or spoken words, may
sometimes prove deceptive too; for the cunning coquette who daily
feigns Love to attract poor moths by her brilliant fascinations,
becomes in time so perfect an actress that the coldest of cynics
may be deceived by her wiles.</p>

<p class='c001'>In his great work on the <cite>Expression of the Emotions</cite>, Darwin
remarks that although, “when lovers meet, we know that their
hearts beat quickly, their breathing is hurried, and their faces
flush;” yet “love can hardly be said to have any proper or peculiar
means of expression; and this is intelligible, as it has not habitually
led to any special line of action. No doubt, as affection is a pleasurable
sensation, it generally causes a gentle smile and some
brightening of the eyes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Inasmuch as a flushed face and transient blushes, a gentle smile
and brightening of the eyes, are characteristic of other emotions
besides Love, Darwin is right; yet he ignores two peculiarities of
expression by which a person in Love may be instantaneously
recognised.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A lover,” says Chamfort, “is a man who endeavours to be
more amiable than it is possible for him to be; and this is the
reason that almost all lovers appear ridiculous.” Who has not
seen this unmistakable, ludicrous expression of masculine Love—head
slightly inclined to the left; face as near her face as possible,
echoing every expression of hers; a saccharine, beseeching smile on
the kiss-hungry lips, producing on the spectator an uneasy sense of
unstable equilibrium—as if in one more moment the force of
amorous gravitation would draw down his face to hers?</p>

<p class='c001'>Add to this his embarrassed gestures, the over-sweet falsetto of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>his voice—an octave higher than when he speaks to others,—and
the peculiar lover’s pallor, and the picture is complete—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Why so pale and wan, fond lover?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Prithee, why so pale?</div>
      <div class='line'>Will, when looking well can’t move her,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Looking ill prevail?”—<span class='sc'>Suckling.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>To women Cupid is kinder. Instead of making them appear
ludicrous, Love has the power of transforming even a homely
feminine face into a vision of loveliness by throwing a halo of
tender expression around it. This wondrous transformation effected
by Love is one of its greatest miracles; and to one who has seen
the girl previously it immediately betrays her infatuation. It is a
kind of <em>emotional calligraphy</em> in which the merest tyro can read,
“I love him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And this temporary transformation of homely into beautiful
faces, this fusing and moulding of the features into forms of voluptuous
expression, is of extreme psychologic interest; for it shows
that, after all, the exalted, extravagant image of Her perfections
in the lover’s mind is not purely imaginary. It is not so much
owing to a difference of “taste” that he loves her more than others
do, as because she actually <em>does</em> look more beautiful when her eyes
are fastened on him than when looking at any other man.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>III.—CARESSES</h3>

<p class='c013'>“Tenderness,” says Professor Bain, “is a pleasurable emotion,
variously stimulated, whose effort is to draw human beings into
mutual embrace.” Darwin finds the peculiarity of love in the same
desire for contact; and, as usual, he seeks for the origin of this
desire, and endeavours to trace it to analogous peculiarities of the
animals most closely related to us.</p>

<p class='c001'>“With the lower animals,” he says, “we see the same principle
of pleasure derived from contact in association with love. Dogs
and cats manifestly take pleasure in rubbing against their masters
and mistresses, and in being rubbed or patted by them. Many
kinds of monkeys, as I am assured by the keepers in the Zoological
Gardens, delight in fondling and being fondled by each other, and
by persons to whom they are attached. Mr. Bartlett has described
to me the behaviour of two Chimpanzees, rather older animals than
those generally imported into this country, when they were first
brought together. They sat opposite, <em>touching each other with their
much-protruded lips</em>, and the one put his hand on the shoulder of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>the other. Then they mutually folded each other in their arms.
Afterwards they stood up, each with one arm on the shoulder of
the other, lifted up their heads, opened their mouths and yelled
with delight.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Concerning human beings Darwin remarks: “A strong desire
to touch the beloved person is commonly felt; and love is expressed
by this means more plainly than by any other. Hence we
long to clasp in our arms those we tenderly love. We probably
owe this desire to <em>inherited habit</em>, in association with the nursing
and tending of our children, and with the mutual caresses of
lovers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>When love first dawns on the mind, the faintest superficial contact
flashes along the nerves as a thrill of delicious emotion. To
walk along the beach in a stiff breeze, and have her veil accidentally
flutter in his face, is a romantic incident on which a youthful
lover’s memory feasts for a month. If allowed to carry her shawl
on his arm, he would not feel the cold of a Siberian winter. And
later, what a variety of tell-tale caresses are there by which mutual
Love may be revealed! It is not the voice alone that can say “I
love you”; nor the speaking eyes. Confessions of Love, proposals
and acceptance—complete dramas of Love—have been enacted by
the language of two pairs of feet that have accidentally touched
under the table. A slight pressure of the hand in the ballroom
has told thousands of lovers, before a word was spoken, that now
they may soon put their arms round that lovely waist without the
excuse of a waltz or polka.</p>

<p class='c001'>One form of hand-caress, dear alike to mothers and lovers, is
thus described by Professor Mantegazza: “In a caress we give
and receive at the same time. The hand which distributes love,
as by a magnetic effusion, receives it in return from the skin of
the beloved person. Hence it is that one of the most common
and most thrilling of the expressions of love consists in passing
the hand through the hair. The hand finds, in this labyrinth of
supple, living threads, the means of multiplying infinitely the
points of amorous contact. It appears as if each hair were an
electric wire, putting us into direct connection with the senses,
with the heart, and even with the thoughts, of those we love. It
is not without reason that woman’s hair has long been given as a
token of love.”</p>

<p class='c001'>What a clumsy thing is language, what an awkward thing a
formal proposal stuttered out by a lover more embarrassed than if
he were an amateur actor appearing on the stage for the first time,
as Romeo before an international audience of actors and critics!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>How much less natural, less poetic, it is to hear the confession of
Love than to feel it—</p>

      <div class='line'>“When panting sighs the bosom fill,</div>

      <div class='line'>At once with one delicious pain.”—<span class='sc'>Clough.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>What poet, and were he a genius in condensation, could
compress into a line, a page, a volume, such an ocean of emotion
as is contained in a momentary caress of the hand? Not even the
moment when the lovers are “imparadised in one another’s arms”
surpasses this in ecstasy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet there is a more delicious rapture still in the drama of
Courtship. “Love’s sweetest language is,” as Herrick says, “a
kiss.” All other caresses are valueless without a kiss; for is not
a kiss the very autograph of Love?</p>

<p class='c001'>But labial contact is a subject of such supreme importance in
the philosophy and history of Love that it cannot be disposed of
briefly as one form of caressing, but demands a chapter by itself.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>KISSING—PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“The lips,” says Sir Charles Bell, “are of all the features the
most susceptible of action, and the most direct index of the
feelings.” No wonder that Cupid selected them as his private
seal, without which no passion can be stamped as genuine.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the expression of all other emotions, by words or signs, one
pair of lips suffices. Love alone requires for its expression two
pairs of lips. Could anything more eloquently demonstrate the
superiority of the romantic passion over all others?</p>

<p class='c001'>Steele said of kissing that “Nature was its author, and it began
with the first courtship.” Steele evidently evolved this theory out
of his “inner consciousness,” for the facts do not agree with it. The
art of Kissing has, like Love itself, been gradually developed in
connection with the higher stages of culture. Traces of it are
found among animals and savages; the ancients often misunderstood
its purport and object, as did our mediæval ancestors; and
it is only in recent times that Kissing has tended to become
what it should be—the special and exclusive language of romantic
and conjugal love.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>AMONG ANIMALS</h3>

<p class='c013'>Honour to whom honour is due. The Chimpanzee seems to
have been the first who discovered the charm of mutual labial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>contact. In the description by Mr. Bartlett just referred to, the
two Chimpanzees “sat opposite, touching each other with their
much-protruded lips.” And in some notes on the Chimpanzee in
Central Park, New York, by Dr. C. Pitfield Mitchell, published in
the <cite>Journal of Comparative Medicine and Surgery</cite>, January 1885,
we find the following: “That tender emotions are experienced
may be inferred from the fact that he pressed the kitten to his
breast and kissed it, holding it very gently in both hands. In
kissing, the lips are pouted and the tongue protruded, and both
are pressed upon the object of affection. The act is not accompanied
by any sound, thus differing from ordinary human
osculation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Dogs, especially when young, may be seen occasionally exchanging
a sort of tongue-kiss; and who has not seen dogs innumerable
times make a sudden sly dash at the lips of master or mistress and
try to <em>steal</em> a kiss? The affectionate manner in which a cow and
calf eagerly lick one another in succession may be regarded as quite
as genuine a kiss as a human kiss on hand, forehead, or cheek; and
it is probable that even in the billing of doves the motive is a
vague pleasure of contact.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>AMONG SAVAGES</h3>

<p class='c013'>we meet once more with the anomalous fact that they seem
ignorant, on the whole, of a clever invention known even to some
animals. Sir John Lubbock, after referring to Steele’s opinion
that kissing is coeval with courtship, remarks: “It was, on the
contrary, entirely unknown to the Tahitians, the New Zealanders,
the Papuas, and the aborigines of Australia, nor was it in use
among the Somals or the Esquimaux.” Jemmy Button, the Fuegian,
told Darwin that kissing was unknown in his land; and another
writer gives an amusing account of an attempt he made to kiss a
young negro girl. She was greatly terrified, probably imagining
him a new species of cannibal who had made up his mind to eat
her on the spot, raw, and without salt and pepper.</p>

<p class='c001'>Monteiro, in a passage previously quoted, says that in all the
long years he has been in Africa he has “never seen a negro put
his arm round a woman’s waist, or give or receive any caress
whatever that would indicate the slightest loving regard or affection
on either side.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Considering the general obtuseness of a savage’s nerves, it is no
wonder that the subtle thrill of a kiss should be unknown to him.
In many cases, moreover, Kissing is rendered physically impossible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>by the habit indulged in of mutilating and enlarging the lips. For
instance, Schweinfurth, in his <cite>Heart of Africa</cite>, says that among
the Bongo women “the lower lip is extended horizontally till it
projects far beyond the upper, which is also bored and fitted with
a copper plate or nail, and now and then by a little ring, and sometimes
by a bit of straw, about as thick as a lucifer match.” Many
other similar cases could be cited.</p>

<p class='c001'>Evidently, under these circumstances, kissing would prove a
snare and a delusion.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>THE ORIGIN OF KISSING</h3>

<p class='c018'>is a topic on which doctors disagree, the opinions of Darwin and
Mr. Spencer in particular differing as widely as their views regarding
the origin of music. Mr. Spencer traces the primitive delight in
osculation to the gustatory sense, Darwin to contact.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Obviously,” says Mr. Spencer, "the billing of doves or pigeons,
and the like action of love-birds, indicates an affection which is
gratified by the gustatory sensation. No act of this kind on the
part of an inferior creature, as of a cow licking a calf, can have any
other origin than the direct prompting of a desire which gains by
the act satisfaction; and in such a case the satisfaction is that
which vivid perception of offspring gives to the maternal yearning.
In some animals like acts arise from other forms of affection. Licking
the hand, or, where it is accessible, the face, is a common display
of attachment on a dog’s part; and when we remember how keen
must be the olfactory sense by which a dog traces his master, we
cannot doubt that to his gustatory sense, too, there is yielded some
impression—an impression associated with those pleasures of
affection which his master’s presence gives.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The inference that kissing, as a mark of fondness in the human
race, has a kindred origin, is sufficiently probable. Though kissing
is not universal—though the negro races do not understand it,
and though, as we have seen, there are cases where sniffing replaces
it—yet, being common to unlikely and widely-dispersed peoples,
we may conclude that it originated in the same manner as the
analogous action among lower creatures.... From kissing as a
natural sign of affection, there is derived the kissing which, as a
means of simulating affection, gratifies those who are kissed; and,
by gratifying them, propitiates them. Hence an obvious root for
the kissing of feet, hands, garments, as a part of ceremonial.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Darwin, on the other hand, holds that kissing “is so far innate
or natural that it apparently depends on pleasure from close
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>contact with a beloved person; and it is replaced in various parts
of the world, by the rubbing of noses, as with the New Zealanders
and Laplanders, by the rubbing or patting of the arms, breasts, or
stomachs, or by one man striking his own face with the hands or
feet of another. Perhaps the practice of blowing, as a mark of
affection, on various parts of the body may depend on the same
principle.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Has Mr. Spencer ever kissed a girl? Certainly, to one who has,
his theory of the gustatory origin of Kissing would seem like a joke
were it not stated with so much scientific pomp and circumstance.
The billing of doves and love-birds, in the first place, cannot be
regarded as a matter of taste, literally, because in birds the sense
of taste is commonly very rudimentary or quite absent, as their
habit of swallowing seeds and other food whole and dry would
make a sense which can only judge of things in a state of solution
quite useless. The sense of touch, on the other hand, is exceedingly
delicate in the bill of birds, which is, as it were, their feeler
or hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>That the motive which prompts cows and calves to lick one
another is likewise tactile rather than gustatory, I had occasion
to observe only a few days ago in a place worthy of so romantic a
subject as the experimental study of kissing. Scene: a green
mountain-meadow above Mürren, Switzerland. Frame of the
picture, a semicircle of snow-giants, including Wetterhorn, Eiger,
Mönch, Jungfrau, Breithorn, etc. Cows and calves in the meadow,
not in the least disturbed by the avalanches thundering down the
side of the Jungfrau every twenty minutes. Cow licks calf, and
calf retaliates by licking the cow’s neck. Cow enjoys it immensely,
holding her head up as high as possible, with an expression of
intense enjoyment, just like a dog when you rub and pat his neck.
Ergo, as cow was not licking but being licked, her enjoyment
must have been tactile, not gustatory. To the cow her tongue
is what the bill is to a bird—her most mobile organ, her feeler,
and hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>Possibly Mr. Spencer was misled into his gustatory theory by
a too literal interpretation of a habit poets have always had of
calling a kiss sweet. Among the Romans a love-kiss was distinguished
from other kisses by being called a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>suavium</i></span> or sweet
thing; and a modern German poet boldly compares the flavour of
kisses to wild strawberries (perhaps she had just been eating some).
Yet all this belongs to fancy’s fairyland. Kisses are called sweet
for the same reason that we speak of the sweet concords of music,
<i>i.e.</i> because the language of æsthetics is so scantily developed that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>we are constantly compelled to borrow terms from one sense and
apply them to another, when their only resemblance is that they
are both agreeable or otherwise.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a very prevalent impression that the senses of savages
are more delicate than ours. In one way they are. A savage can
often see an object at a greater distance, and hear a fainter sound,
than a white man. But in what may be called æsthetic as distinguished
from physical refinement, savages are vastly our inferiors.
A savage can hardly tell the difference between two adjacent notes
in the musical scale, while a musician can distinguish the sixtieth
part of a semitone. And why would the wondrous harmonies of
a Chopin nocturne seem a mere chaos of sound to a savage? Because
his ears have not been trained through his imagination and
intellect to discriminate sounds and sound-combinations, or to
follow the plot or development of a musical narrative or “theme.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Just so with the sense of touch. A sweetheart’s veil fluttering
in a Hottentot’s face would only annoy him. A squeeze of the
hand would leave him cold; and would he refrain from putting
his arm round her waist if that gave him any pleasure? Obviously,
then, the reason why the art of kissing is unknown to him is because
his senses are too callous, his imagination too sluggish.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kissing, like every other fine art, has its sensuous and its
imaginative or intellectual side. Of all parts of the visible body
the lips are the most sensitive to contact. Here the layer in
which the nerves and blood-vessels are contained is not covered
over, as elsewhere on the skin, by a thick leathery epidermis, but
only thinly veiled by a transparent epithelium; so that when lips
are applied to lips, the blood-vessels which carry the vital fluid
straight from the two loving hearts, and the soul-fibres, called
nerves, are brought into almost immediate contact: whence that
interchange of soul-magnetism—that electric shock which makes
the first mutual kiss of Love the sweetest moment of life—</p>

      <div class='line'>So thrilling and sincere as thine?”—<span class='sc'>Burns.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Yet herein the imagination plays a much more prominent <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span>
than it appears to do at first sight. The real reason why a savage
cannot enjoy a kiss is not so much because his lips are deficient in
tactile sensibility, as because he has no imagination to invest labial
contact with the romance of individualised passion. If a lover’s
pleasure lay in the mere labial contact, he would as soon exchange
a kiss with any other girl. But should a sweetheart, on being
asked for a kiss, refer him, say, to his sister or her sister; though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>the latter be a hundred times more beautiful, he would chide his
love for offering a stone where bread was wanted. His imagination
has so long painted to him the superior ecstasy of a kiss from
her that, when he finally gets it, the long-deferred gratification
ensures the unparalleled rapture anticipated.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>ANCIENT KISSES</h3>

<p class='c013'>As the ancient civilised nations were much more addicted than
we are to gesture language, it seems natural that so expressive a
sign as kissing should have been used for a variety of purposes—for
indicating not only family affection, sexual passion and friendship,
but general respect, reverence, humility, condescension, etc.
Among idolatrous nations, as M‘Clintock and Strong remark, “it
was the custom to throw kisses towards the images of the gods,
and towards the sun and moon.” Kissing the hand appears to be
a modern custom, but many other parts of the body were thus
saluted by the ancients: “Kissing the feet of princes was a token
of subjection and obedience, which was sometimes carried so far
that the print of the foot received the kiss, so as to give the impression
that the very dust had become sacred by the royal tread,
or that the subject was not worthy to salute even the prince’s
foot, but was content to kiss the earth itself near or on which he
trod.” A similar observance is the kissing of the Pope’s toe, or
rather, the cross on his slipper—a custom in vogue since the year
710. Among the Arabs the women and children kiss the beards
of their husbands or fathers. Among the ancient Hebrews, “kissing
the lips by way of affectionate salutation was not only permitted,
but customary among near relatives of both sexes, both in
patriarchal and in later times.” The kiss on the cheek “has at
all times been customary in the East, and can hardly be said to be
extinct even in Europe.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the ancient Greeks, Jealousy prompted the husbands to
“make their wives eat onions whenever they were going from
home.” And in the Roman Republic, “Among the safeguards of
female purity,” says Mr. Lecky, “was an enactment forbidding
women even to taste wine.... Cato said that the ancient Romans
were accustomed to kiss their wives for the purpose of discovering
whether they had been drinking wine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Breath-sweetening cloves and cachous were evidently unknown
in the good old times.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Romans had special names for three kinds of kisses—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>basium</i></span>,
a kiss of politeness; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>osculum</i></span>, between friends; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>suavium</i></span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>between lovers. If a man kissed his betrothed, she gained thereby
the half of his effects in the event of his dying before the celebration
of the marriage; and if the lady herself died, under the same
circumstances, her heirs or nearest of kin took the half due to
her, a kiss among the ancients being a sign of plighted faith.
So seriously, indeed, was a kiss regarded by the ancient Romans,
that a husband would not even kiss his wife in presence of his
daughters.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was on account of this strict feeling regarding kisses exchanged
by man and woman that the early Christians subjected
themselves to fierce attacks and slander, because of the kisses that
were exchanged as a symbol of religious union at the Love-Feasts
of the first disciples. “But, in 397, the Council of Carthage
thought fit to forbid all religious kissing between the sexes, notwithstanding
St. Paul’s exhortation, ‘Greet ye one another with
a kiss of charity.’”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>MEDIÆVAL KISSES</h3>

<p class='c013'>Among many other refinements of the ancients, the mediæval
nations lost the sense of the sacredness of kissing between the
sexes. England was apparently the greatest sinner in this respect;
for it appears to have been customary on visiting to kiss the host’s
wife and daughters. Indeed, up to a comparatively recent time,
kissing on every occasion was almost as prevalent and permissible
as handshaking is at the present day. In the sixteenth century
it was customary in England for ladies to reward their partners
in the dance with a kiss; and for a long time the minister who
united a couple in the holy bonds of matrimony had the privilege
of kissing not only the bride but even the bridesmaids! No
wonder the ministry was the most popular profession in those
days.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is quite certain,” says a writer in the <cite>St. James’s Magazine</cite>
(1871), “that the custom of kissing was brought into England
from Friesland, as St. Pierius Wensemius, historiographer to their
High Mightinesses, the states of Friesland, in his <cite>Chronicle</cite>, 1622,
tells us that the pleasant practice of kissing was utterly ‘unpractised
and unknown in England till the fair Princess Romix
(Rowena), the daughter of King Hengist of Friesland, pressed the
beaker with her lippens, and saluted the amorous Vortigern with
a kusjen’ (little kiss).”</p>

<p class='c001'>Having recovered this lost art, however, the English lost no
time in making up for neglected opportunities. Erasmus writes
in one of his epistles: “If you go to any place (in Britain) you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>are received with a <em>kiss</em> by all; if you depart on a journey, you
are dismissed with a kiss; you return, kisses are exchanged ...
wherever you move, nothing but kisses. And if you, Faustus, had
but once tasted them,—how soft they are, how fragrant! on my
honour, you would wish not to reside here for ten years only, but
for life!!!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bunyan, however, frowned on this practice, and inquired most
pertinently—and impertinently—why the men only “salute the
most handsome and let the ill-favoured alone?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepys, in his <cite>Diary</cite> for 1660, gives this account of some
Portuguese ladies in London: “I find nothing in them that is
pleasing; and I see they have <em>learnt to kiss</em>, and look freely up and
down already, and I do believe will soon forget the recluse practice
of their own country.”</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the luckiest of mortals was Bulstrode Whitelock, who
at the Court of Christine of Sweden was asked to teach her ladies
“the English mode of salutation; which, after some pretty
defences, their lips obeyed, and <em>Whitelock most readily</em>!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The following extraordinary kissing story is told in <cite>Chambers’s
Journal</cite> for 1861:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“When the gallant cardinal, Count of Lorraine, was presented
to the Duchess of Savoy, she gave him her hand to kiss, greatly
to the indignation of the irate churchman. ‘How, madame,’
exclaimed he, ‘am I to be treated in this manner? I kiss the
queen, my mistress, who is the greatest queen in the world, and
shall I not kiss you, a <em>dirty little duchess</em>? I would have you
know I have kissed as handsome ladies, and of as great or greater
family than you.’ Without more ado he made for the lips of the
proud Portuguese princess, and, despite her resistance, kissed her
thrice on her mouth before he released her with an exultant
laugh.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The fashion of universal kissing appears to have gone out about
the time of the Restoration.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>MODERN KISSES</h3>

<p class='c013'>The history of kissing, thus briefly sketched, shows that among
primitive men this art is unknown because they are incapable of
appreciating it. To the ancient civilised nations its charms were
revealed; but as usual in the intoxication of a new discovery, they
hardly knew what to do with it, and applied it to all sorts of
stupid ceremonial purposes. The tendency of civilisation, however,
has been to eliminate promiscuous kissing, and restrict it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>more and more to its proper function as an expression of the
affections. And even within this sphere the circle becomes gradually
smaller. Although in some parts of Europe men still kiss
one another as a token of relationship, friendship, or esteem, yet the
habit is slowly dying out, the example having been set in England,
where it was abandoned toward the close of the seventeenth
century. The senseless custom which women to-day indulge in of
kissing each other on the slightest provocation, often when they
would rather slap one another in the face, is also doomed to
extinction. The witticism that women kiss one another because
they cannot find anything better to kiss, differing herein from
men, was not perpetrated by a woman. The practice of kissing
little children has been often enough condemned on medical
grounds, which also hold good in the case of adults. That contagious
diseases are thus often conveyed from one person to
another was already known to the ancient Romans, one of whose
emperors issued a special proclamation in consequence against promiscuous
kissing.</p>

<p class='c001'>From a sentimental point of view, the most objectionable of
modern kisses are those which are allowed between cousins. As
long as a man may become a suitor for the hand of his cousin he
should, both for the sake of his own love-drama and in justice to
a possible rival, be debarred from this privilege. Imagine the
feelings of a lover who knows that his rival has been permitted to
steal the virgin kiss from the lips of his adored one simply because
his father happens to be her uncle! Family kisses should, therefore,
be allowed only within that degree of relationship which
precludes the idea of Love and marriage. Cousins will have to be
satisfied in future with a warmer grasp of the hand and an extra
lump of sugar in a maiden’s smile.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>LOVE-KISSES</h3>

<p class='c013'>The happiest moment in the life of the happiest man is that
when he is allowed for the first time to “steal immortal blessing”
from the lips of her who has just promised to be his for ever.
No wonder the poets have grown eloquent over this supreme
moment of pre-heavenly rapture—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps the longest kiss on record is that which Siegfried gives
Brünnhilde in the drama of <cite>Siegfried</cite>. But this is not an ordinary
kiss, for the hero has to wake with it the Valkyrie from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>twenty years’ sleep into which old Wotan had plunged her for disobeying
his orders. Thanks to Wagner’s art, the thrill of this
Love-kiss, magically transmuted into tones, is felt by a thousand
spectators simultaneously with the lover.</p>

<p class='c001'>Love-kisses are innumerable. Thus sings the Italian poet,
Cecco Angiolieri, in the thirteenth century—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Because the stars are fewer in heaven’s span</div>
      <div class='line'>Than all those kisses wherewith I kept time</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Novelists and poets have exhausted their ingenuity in finding
adjectives descriptive of Love-kisses and others. An anonymous
essayist has compiled the following list:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Kisses are forced, unwilling, cold, comfortless, frigid, and
frozen, chaste, timid, rosy, balmy, humid, dewy, trembling, soft,
gentle, tender, tempting, fragrant, sacred, hallowed, divine, soothing,
joyful, affectionate, delicious, rapturous, deep-drawn, impressive,
quick, and nervous, warm, burning, impassioned, inebriating,
ardent, flaming, and akin to fire, ravishing, lingering, long. One
also hears of parting, tear-dewed, savoury, loathsome, poisonous,
treacherous, false, rude, stolen, and great fat, noisy kisses.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>HOW TO KISS</h3>

<p class='c013'>Kissing comes by instinct, and yet it is an art which few understand
properly. A lover should not hold his bride by the ears in
kissing her, as appears to have been customary at Scotch weddings
of the last century. A more graceful way, and quite effective
in preventing the bride from “getting away,” is to put your right
arm round her neck, your fingers under her chin, raise the chin,
and then gently but firmly press your lips on hers. After a few
repetitions she will find out it doesn’t hurt, and become as gentle
as a lamb.</p>

<p class='c001'>The word adoration is derived from kissing. It means literally
to apply to the mouth. Therefore girls should beware of philologists
who may ask them with seemingly harmless intent, “May I
adore you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>In kissing, as in everything else, honesty is the best policy.
Stolen kisses are not the sweetest, as Leigh Hunt would have us
believe. A kiss to be a kiss must be mutual, voluntary, simultaneous.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>“The kiss snatched hasty from the sidelong maid” is
not worth having. A stolen kiss is only half a kiss.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>HOW TO WIN LOVE</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>BRASS BUTTONS</h3>

<p class='c013'>Inasmuch as language is the least eloquent and effective mode
of expressing Love, and inasmuch as Love is commonly inspired in
woman by the possession of qualities which she lacks, it is obvious
that Shakspere did not show his usual insight into human nature
when he wrote—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“That man that hath a tongue is, I say, no man,</div>
      <div class='line'>If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>It seems, indeed, quite probable that Bacon wrote those two
lines; if Shakspere had written them he would have said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“That man that hath a uniform is, I say, no man,</div>
      <div class='line'>If with his uniform he cannot win a woman.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The extraordinary infatuation for military uniforms shown by
women of all times and countries is one of the most obscure
problems in mental and social philosophy. Whenever an officer,
though ever so humble in rank, is present at a ball or other social
gathering, all other men, be they merchants, politicians, lawyers,
physicians, artists, students, ministers, are simply “nowhere.”</p>

<p class='c001'>What is the cause of this singular infatuation? Is it the
colour-harmony formed by the complementary blue cloth and
yellow buttons? No, for various officials, as well as messenger
boys, wear similar uniforms without making any special impression
on the feminine heart. Is it the beauty or the wit of the soldier?
No, for he may be as stupid as a log, and red-nosed and smallpox-pitted,
without losing a jot of his popularity. Nor can it be his
valour, for he has perhaps never yet been opposite the “business
end” of a rifle, as they say out West. Nor, again, is it likely
that women admire soldiers from an inherited sense of gratitude
for the services they rendered in former warlike times in protecting
their great-great-grandmothers from the enemy’s barbarity; for
woman’s gratitude is not apt to be so very retrospective, while
gratitude itself is less apt to inspire Love than aversion.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>Whatever may be the cause of this mysterious phenomenon,
the fact remains that officers are woman’s ideals. Hence the first
and most important hint to those who would win a woman’s Love
is: Put brass buttons on your coat, have it dyed blue, and wear
epaulettes and a waxed moustache. This love-charm has never
been known to fail.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CONFIDENCE AND BOLDNESS</h3>

<p class='c013'>Women secretly detest bashful men. It is their own duty,
prescribed by etiquette, to be passive, shy, and diffident; hence if
men were shy and diffident too, no advances would be made, and
all progress in Love-making would be retarded.</p>

<p class='c001'>Women love courage. He who robs lions of their hearts can
easily win a woman’s.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>“Our doubts are traitors,</div>
      <div class='line'>And make us lose the good we oft might win</div>
      <div class='line'>By fearing to attempt,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>says Shakspere; and Chesterfield remarks <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>à propos</i></span>, that “that
silly sanguine notion which is firmly entertained here, that one
Englishman can beat three Frenchmen, encourages and has sometimes
enabled one Englishman in reality to beat two.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ovid knew the value of boldness. And although his object
was not to teach how to win permanent Love, but how to get
honey without taking care of the bees, yet his psychology is
correct, and agrees with Goethe’s aphorism that “if thou approachest
women with tenderness thou winnest them with a word;
but he who is bold and saucy comes off better.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps this is one reason why officers are so successful in
Love, for several of them have been known to be bold and saucy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another reason may be that their pursuit is more distinctively
and exclusively masculine than any other profession.</p>

<p class='c001'>What, for instance, could be more delightfully masculine, <i>i.e.</i>
mediæval, than the way in which, according to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Chronicon
Turonense</cite></span>, William the Conqueror wooed and won Mathilde, the
daughter of Count Baldwin, Prince of Flanders. At first he was
unsuccessful, “for the young girl,” says Professor Scherr, “declared
proudly she would not marry a bastard. Then William
rode to Bruges, waylaid Mathilde, attacked her when she came
from church, pulled her long hair, and maltreated her with his
fists and with kicks, after which heroic performance he made his
escape. Strange to say, this peculiar mode of Love-making
imposed so greatly on the beauty that she declared with tears in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>her eyes that she would marry no one but the Norman Duke,
whom she actually did marry. A parallel case may be found in
the German <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Nibelungenlied</cite></span> (str. 870 and 901).”</p>

<p class='c001'>Since, according to the old philosophy, human nature, including
Love and Love-making, is the same at all times and in all
countries, it follows that a modern lover, after donning his brass
buttons, should administer his sweetheart a sound thrashing.
That will make her mellow and docile.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>PLEASANT ASSOCIATIONS</h3>

<p class='c013'>The Germans, it is well known, are deficient in Gallantry, at
least in conjugal life, and often treat their wives more as upper
servants than as companions. Perhaps it was the unconscious
desire to justify this conjugal attitude that induced one of the
leading German psychologists, Horwicz, to pen these lines:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Love can only be excited by strong and vivid emotions, and
it is almost immaterial whether these emotions are agreeable or
disagreeable. The Cid wooed the proud heart of Donna Ximene,
whose father he had slain, by shooting one after another of her
pet pigeons. Such persons as arouse in us only weak emotions,
or none at all, are obviously least likely to incline us toward
them.... Our aversion is most apt to be bestowed on individuals
who, as the phrase goes, are ‘neither warm nor cold’; whereas
impulsive, choleric people, though they may readily offend us, are
just as capable of making us warmly attached to them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>How that modern genius, who lived two thousand years ago
and called himself Ovid, would have opened his eyes in wonder at
this German-mediæval Art of Love! He, queer fellow, believed
that a lover should never be otherwise than pleasantly associated
in his sweetheart’s mind. If she is spoiled by over-indulgence,
do not, he says in effect, take away her dainties with your own
hand. If she is unwell, do not hand her the bitter medicine in
person: “Let your rival mix the cup for her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So long as the professional manslayer is the highest ideal of
woman’s tender heart, lovers will do well to follow mediæval
methods of Courtship and make themselves as disagreeable as
possible. When the millennium arrives, and wholesale duels to
avenge offended national “honour” will, like private duels to
avenge individual “honour,” have become obsolete, then the
Ovidian psychology of Love will begin to prevail. Then will
the lover endeavour to avoid all harshness and to be only agreeably
associated in the mind of his goddess—through bright,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>cheerful conversation, harmless and sincere compliments, mutual
enjoyment of excursions and artistic entertainments, the avoidance
of disagreeable topics, of jealous suspicions and reproaches, etc.;
hoping thus to become the nucleus around which her dreams of
matrimonial happiness will gradually crystallise.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>PERSEVERANCE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Persistence alone may win a woman where all other means fail.
She may dream of an ideal lover and vainly wait for his appearance
for several years; and in the meantime the image of her
ever-present suitor will become brighter and more inviting in her
mind. For is not perseverance, is not unflagging devotion to a
single aim, one of the noblest of manly attributes, a guarantee of
success in life and the highest test of genuine passion?</p>

<p class='c001'>Perseverance may neutralise more than one refusal.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Have you not heard it said full oft</div>
      <div class='line'>A woman’s nay doth stand for naught?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>asks Shakspere; and Byron teaches that she</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Who listens once will listen <a id='corr241.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='twice'>twice;</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_241.18'><ins class='correction' title='twice'>twice;</ins></a></span></div>
      <div class='line'>Her heart, be sure, is not of ice,</div>
      <div class='line'>And one refusal no rebuff.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The fact that a proposal is the sincerest compliment a man can
pay a woman, contributes not a little to make a second proposal
more acceptable. A third should rarely be attempted. The first
proposal may have been refused more from momentary embarrassment
than from real indifference. The second, being weighted by
reflection, is generally final, though numerous exceptions have
occurred; yet in such cases it is probable that the woman gives
her hand without her heart, having at last discovered that her
heart is impervious to all Love. There are hundreds of thousands
of such women, and some of them are very sweet and pretty. The
fault lies in their shallow education.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>FEIGNED INDIFFERENCE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Of every ten disappointed lovers seven might say: Had I been
a less submissive slave, I might have been a more successful suitor.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is a rule of manners,” says Emerson, “to avoid exaggeration....
In man or woman the face and the person lose power
when they are on the strain to express admiration.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>In other words, one of the ways of winning Love is through
stolidity and indifference, real or feigned.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were women the paragons of subtle insight they are painted,
they would favour those who are most visibly affected by their
charms, as being best able to appreciate and cherish them. There
are such women—a few; but the majority are partial coquettes,
to whom Love is known only as a form of Vanity, who neglect a
man already won, and reserve their sweetest smiles for those that
seem less submissive. The artificial dignity under which so many
young society men hide their mental vacuity has an irresistible
fascination for the average society girl. And the high collar,
which helps to keep the head in a dignified position, unswerved
by emotion, is responsible for innumerable conquests.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ergo, to win a society girl’s heart, wear a high collar, appear
awfully dignified and stolid, and show not the slightest interest in
anything. Above all, if you are of superior intelligence, carefully
conceal the fact. Brains are not “good form” in society; for
what’s the use of having flint where there is no steel to strike a
spark? “Stolidity,” says Schopenhauer, “does not injure a man
in a woman’s eye: rather will mental superiority, and still more
genius, as something abnormal, have an unfavourable influence.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A passage from Diderot’s <cite>Paradox of Acting</cite> (Pollock’s translation)
may be cited in illustration of Schopenhauer’s remark.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Take two lovers, both of whom have their declarations to
make. Who will come out of it best? Not I, I promise you.
I remember that I approached the beloved object with fear and
trembling; my heart beat, my ideas grew confused, my voice
failed me, I mangled all I said; I cried <em>yes</em> for <em>no</em>; I made a
thousand blunders; I was inimitably inept; I was absurd from
top to toe, and the more I saw it the more absurd I became.
Meanwhile, under my very eyes, a gay rival, light-hearted and
agreeable, master of himself, pleased with himself, losing no
opportunity for the finest flattery, made himself entertaining and
agreeable, enjoyed himself; he implored the touch of a hand
which was at once given him, he sometimes caught it without
asking leave, he kissed it once and again. I the while, alone in
a corner, avoided a sight which irritated me, stifling my sighs,
cracking my fingers with grasping my wrists, plunged in melancholy,
covered with a cold sweat, I could neither show nor conceal
my vexation. People say of love that it robs witty men of their
wit, and gives it to those who had none before: in other words,
makes some people sensitive and stupid, others cold and adventurous.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>Another specialist in Love-lore, Lord Byron, discourses on this
text in five pithy lines—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Not much he kens, I ween, of woman’s breast</div>
      <div class='line'>Who thinks that wanton thing is won by sighs,</div>
      <div class='line'>Do proper homage to thine idol’s eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'><em>But not too humbly or she will despise;</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Disguise even tenderness, if thou art wise</em>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And even the king of German metaphysicians, old Kant, understood
this feminine foible, which may have been the reason why
he never found a wife: “An actor,” he says, “who remains unmoved,
but possesses a powerful intellect and imagination, may
succeed in producing a deeper impression by his feigned emotion
than he could by real emotion. One who is truly in love is, in
presence of his beloved, confused, awkward, and anything but
fascinating. But a clever man who merely plays the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span> of a
lover may do it so naturally as to easily ensnare his poor victim;
simply because, his heart being unmoved, his head remains clear,
and he can, therefore, make the most of his wits and his cleverness
in presenting the counterfeit of a lover.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The counterfeit of a lover.” It is he, then, whom women,
according to these French, English, and German witnesses, encourage,
instead of the true lover. So that women are not only
less capable of deep Love than men, but they do not even promote
the growth and survival of Love by favouring the men most deeply
affected by it. And the fault, be it said once more, lies in the
superficial education not only of their intellect but of their emotions,
for the heart can only be reached and refined through the
brain. The average woman, being incapable of feeling Love, is
incapable of appreciating it when she finds it in a man. She sees
only its ridiculous side—and ridicule is fatal, even to Love. Ridicule
killed Love in France, which to-day is the most loveless
country in the civilised world, its women the most frivolous and
heartless,—and its population gradually diminishing.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ridiculous exaggerations of a lover are indeed harmless if
the girl is in love too, for then she does not see them; but to one
who has yet to win Love, as girls are now constituted, they are
fatal. Perhaps this is the reason why the list of men of genius
who failed in their truest Love is so extraordinarily large: for,
their Love being more ardent than that of others, they were unable
to restrain its excesses and feign indifference; while another way
in which they “lost power” was through their extravagant admiration
of Beauty, which put their faces “on the strain” to
express it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>However this may be, lovers should keep in mind this paradoxical
rule, which follows as a corollary from the foregoing discussion:</p>

<p class='c001'>In order to win a woman, first cure yourself of your passion,
then, having won her through feigned indifference (which is easy),
fall in love again and bag her before she has had time to discover
your change of feeling.</p>

<p class='c001'>The only difficulty herein lies in the cure. Should this be
found impossible, even with the aid of our next chapter, one last
resource is open to the lover. Says La Bruyère: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Quand l’on a
assez fait auprès d’une femme pour devoir l’engager, il y a encore
une ressource, qui est de ne plus rien faire; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>c’est alors qu’elle vous
rappelle</i></span>.”</span> In other words, if you have failed to win her love, with
all your attentions, change your policy: leave her alone, and she
will be sure to recall you.</p>

<p class='c001'>This trait is not simply the outcome of feminine perverseness
or coquetry. The explanation lies deeper. Every sensible woman,
be she ever so vain and accustomed to flattery, is painfully conscious
of certain defects, physical or mental. “Has he discovered
them?” she will anxiously ask herself when the sly lover suddenly
withdraws; “I must recover his good opinion.” So she sets herself
the task of fascinating and pleasing him; and this desire to
please (Gallantry) being one of the constituent parts of Love, it
is apt to be soon joined by the other symptoms which make up
the romantic passion.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>COMPLIMENTS</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O flatter me, for love delights in praises,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>exclaims one of Shakspere’s characters; and again—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;</div>
      <div class='line'>Tho’ ne’er so black, say they have angels’ faces.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There is one advantage in writing about the romantic passion.
Love is such a tissue of paradoxes, and exists in such an endless
variety of forms and shades that you may say almost anything
about it you please, and it is likely to be correct. So again here.
It is true, no doubt, that skill in the art of flattery helps a man
to win a woman’s goodwill, but how does this rhyme with the
doctrine that Feigned Indifference is the lover’s sharpest weapon?</p>

<p class='c001'>Answer: A compliment is not so much an expression of Love
as of simple æsthetic admiration; or else it may spring from the
flatterer’s desire to show off his wit. A man may compliment a
woman for whom he does not feel the slightest Love; and women
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>know it. Therefore even a coquette does not despise and ignore
a man who flatters her, as she invariably does one whose <em>actions</em>
brand him as her captive and slave.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time, since the desire to be considered beautiful
is the strongest passion in a woman’s heart, the avenue to that
heart may often be found by a man who can convince her honestly
that she is considered beautiful by himself and others. For, as
every man of ability has moments when he doubts his genius, so
every woman has moments when she doubts her beauty and longs
to see it in the mirror of a masculine eye.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most common mistake of lovers is to compliment a woman
on her most conspicuous points of beauty. This has very much
the same effect on her as telling Rubinstein he is a wonderful
pianist. He knows that better than you do, and has been told so
so many million times that he is sick and tired of hearing it again.
But show him that you have discovered some special subtle detail
of excellence in his performance or compositions that had escaped
general notice, and his heart is yours at once and for ever. A
lover can have no difficulty in discovering such subtle charms in
his sweetheart, for Cupid, while blinding him to her defects, places
her beauties under a microscope.</p>

<p class='c001'>A man who attends a social gathering comes home pleased,
not at having heard a number of bright things, but in proportion
to his own success in amusing the company. On the same principle,
if you give a girl—especially one who mistrusts her conversational
ability—a chance to say a single bright thing, she will love
you more than if you said a hundred clever things to her.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sincerity in compliments is essential; else all is lost. It is
useless to try to convince a woman with an ugly mouth or nose
that those features are not ugly. She knows they are ugly, as
well as Rubinstein knows when he strikes a wrong note. “Very
ugly or very beautiful women,” says Chesterfield, “should be
flattered on their understanding, and mediocre ones on their
beauty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A clever joke is never out of place. You may intimate to a
comparatively plain woman that she is good-looking, and if she
retorts with a sceptical answer, you may snub her and score ten
points in Love by telling her you pity her poor taste.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed, the art of successful flattery, especially with modern
self-conscious girls, consists in the ability of giving “a heartfelt
compliment in the disguise of playful raillery,” as Coleridge puts
it. Conundrums are very useful. For instance, Angelina is
patting a dog. “Do you know why all dogs are so fond of you?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>asks Adolphus. Angelina gives it up. “Because dogs are the
most intelligent of all animals.” Angelina goes to Paris, and
Adolphus enjoys his last walk with her. They pass a weeping
willow. “Why are we two like this tree?” She gives it up again.
“A weeping willow is graceful and melancholy; you are graceful,
I melancholy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How old am I?” asks Angelina. “I don’t know. Judging
by your conversation thirty-five, by your looks nineteen.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Tell a woman—casually, as it were—of the effect of her
charms on a third party, and it will please her more than a bushel
of your neatest compliments. As Lessing remarks, Homer gives
us a more vivid sense of Helen’s beauty by noting its effect even
on the Trojan elders, than he could have done by the most minute
enumeration of her charms. Put your flatteries into actions rather
than words—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“mettre la flatterie dans les actions et non en paroles”</span>—is
Balzac’s advice. But “flattery in actions” is simply another
name for Gallantry.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no danger that the subtlest compliment will ever
escape notice. In the discovery of praise the commonest mind has
the quickness of genius.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>LOVE-LETTERS</h3>

<p class='c013'>The great trouble with compliments is that they have an annoying
habit of occurring to the mind about ten or twenty minutes
after the natural opportunity for getting them off has passed
away. It is here that Love-letters come to the rescue. They
enable a man to excogitate the most excruciatingly subtle and
hyperbolic compliments, and then “lead up to them” most
naturally.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is an old superstition that Love-letters <em>must</em> be incoherent
trash to be genuine evidences of passion. When Keats’s
Love-letters to Fanny Brawne were sold at auction, a spicy journalist
commented as follows on the occasion:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is open to question whether, like so many of the letter-writers
of the age of which Keats inherited the traditions, the
singer of <cite>Endymion</cite> had not a shrewd eye to posterity when he
wrote the laboured compositions which the world regards as the
record of his wooing. The manuscript is painfully correct, the
punctuation worthy of a printer’s reader, the capitals much nicer
than fiery lovers usually form, and the periods rounded with painful
care. Like so many cultivators of the art of letter-writing,
the sensitive poet, ‘who was snuffed out by a review,’ seems to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>have copied the gush, which last week sold for ten times more
than <cite>Endymion</cite> fetched, before he committed it to the fourpenny
post. Hence the veriest scrawl, the most illegible postcard of
these times is, as an index to the writer’s character, infinitely more
valuable than the ponderous pieces of rhetoric which last century
passed for love-making between Strephon, who quotes the elegant
Tully, and Chloe, who makes free use of the ‘Elegant Extracts.’
Duller fustian than such priggish love-letters it is hard to conceive.
They remind one of nothing so much as the epistles copied out of
<cite>The Complete Letter-Writer</cite>, and must recall to some middle-aged
men certain painful experiences of those salad days when their
young affections suffered a sudden blight by missives of so severely
correct an order that they suggest the idea of having undergone
maternal supervision.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet why, pray, should Keats <em>not</em> have written his Love-letters
so carefully and copied them so neatly? Is it not a fact that
when a man is in love he cares more to make a pleasing impression
on one particular person than on all the rest of the world combined?
and that even his ambition and fame, for which he labours
so hard, seem valuable in his eyes solely as a means of winning
Her Love? And if Love is a deeper passion, even in a poet, than
ambition, why should he not go to the extent even of <em>taking notes</em>
and utilising his very best conceits in his Love-letters? The
truth is, in the writing of Love-letters everything depends on
the man’s habits. If he is accustomed to writing carelessly, his
Love-letters will probably be hasty and slovenly enough to suit
orthodox notions on this subject. But if he is a literary artist,
he will probably polish his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>billets-doux</i></span> more than anything else
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>con amore</i></span>, considering the probable effect on her mind of every
sentence. And although the thought of future publication may
enter his mind, it will appear as the veriest trifle compared with
the more important object of winning a woman’s Love by a
display of complimentary wit and passionate protestations of undying
affection.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sir Richard Steele evidently did not believe that Love-letters,
to be genuine, must be slovenly. In one of his letters to Miss
Scurlock he apologises for not having time to revise what he had
written. In another letter he exclaims: “How art thou, oh my
soul, stolen from thyself! how is all my attention broken! my
books are blank paper, and my friends intruders.” Again: “It
is the hardest thing in the world to be in love, and yet attend
business. As for me, all that speak to find me out, and I must
lock myself up, or other people will do it for me. A gentleman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>asked me this morning, ‘What news from Holland?’ and I
answered, ‘She is exquisitely handsome.’ Another desired to
know when I had been last at Windsor; I replied, ‘She designs
to go with me.’” And once more: “It is to my lovely charmer I
owe that many noble ideas are continually affixed to my words and
actions: it is the natural effect of that generous passion to create
in the admirers some similitude of the object admired; thus, my
dear, am I every day to improve from so sweet a companion.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The first score or so of Keats’s Love-letters have the ring of
true gold. Here are a few specimens in which the thermometer
of endearments rises steadily from My Dearest Lady, through My
Sweet Girl, My Dear Girl, My Dearest Girl, My Sweet Fanny,
to My Sweet Love, Dearest Love and Sweetest Fanny. In the
very first letter he writes:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ask yourself, my love, whether you are not very cruel to
have so entrammelled me, so destroyed my freedom. Will you
confess this in the letter you must write immediately? and do all
you can to console me in it—make it rich as a draught of poppies
to intoxicate me—write the softest words and kiss them, that I
may at least touch my lips where yours have been. For myself,
if I do not know how to express my devotion to so fair a form, I
want a brighter word than bright, a fairer word than fair. I
almost wish we were butterflies, and lived but three summer days—three
such days with you I could fill with more delight than
fifty common years could ever contain.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“All I can bring you is a swooning admiration of your
beauty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have two luxuries to brood over in my walks—your loveliness
and the hour of my death. O that I could have possession
of them both in the same minute.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I hate the world: it batters too much the wings of my self-will,
and would I could take a sweet poison from your lips to send
me out of it. From no others would I take it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“At Winchester I shall get your letters more readily; and it
being a cathedral city, I shall have a pleasure, always a great one
to me when near a cathedral, of reading them during the service
up and down the aisle.”</p>

<p class='c001'>All this is in the true Shaksperian key of Romantic Love,
as are the Love-letters of Burns, Byron, Moore, Heine, Bürger,
Lenau, and most other poets. Room must be made here for a
few extracts from Lenau’s letters to his love, which, in some
respects, resemble those of Keats—equally polished, poetic, deep,
and sincere:—</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>“It makes me melancholy to see how incapable I am of sympathizing
with the pleasures of my friends. My Love goes out afar
towards you; it hearkens and listens and stares in the distance for
you, and takes no note of all the love by which it is surrounded
here. I am truly ill. I constantly think of you alone and death.
It often seems to me as if my time had expired. I cannot write
poetry, I cannot rejoice in anything, cannot hope, can only think
of you and death. The other day I wrote to you to take good
care of your health—though I myself feel so little desire to live.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The whole evening I was unable to think of anything but of
you and the possibility of losing you. The large crowd of people
seemed to have assembled on purpose to show me most painfully
what a mere nothing the world would be to me if I had to part
from you. I constantly saw but your face, your lovely, divine
eye.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Alexander wishes me to go to the baths at Leuk with him.
He is quite ill. But I cannot go. If I have to see Switzerland
without you, I prefer not to see it at all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My poetic composition is in a bad way. Though a thought
sprouts in me here and there, it withers before it has reached
maturity. When I go to see you I shall bring along a dry wreath
of prematurely-faded poetic blossoms, and make them revive in
your presence, as there are warm fountains dipped into which faded
flowers blossom again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have lost all pleasure in other people when you are absent.
If you had only been at Weinsberg! Even the Æolian harps did
not produce the usual impression on me.” It is noticeable how
the overtone of Monopoly is accented in all these plaints.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have found in your companionship more evidence of an
eternal life than in all my investigations and studies of nature.
Whenever, in a happy hour, I believed I had reached the climax
of Love and the proper moment for death, since a more delicious
moment could never follow: it was on each occasion an illusion,
for another hour followed in which I loved you still more deeply.
These ever new, ever deeper abysses of life convince me of its
immortality. To-day I saw in your eyes the full measure of the
divine. Most distinctly did I perceive to-day that the swelling and
sinking of the eye is the breathing of the soul. In an eye of such
beauty as yours we can see, as in a prophetic hieroglyphic, the
essence of which some day our immortal body will consist. If I
die, I shall depart rich, for I have seen what is most beautiful in
the world.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The rose you gave me at parting has a most delicious fragrance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>as if it were a Good-Night from you! Sleep well, dearest
heart! Preserve the second rose as a memento. I love you
immeasurably.”</p>

<p class='c001'>No doubt the average Love-letters read in courts of justice in
breach of promise cases, to the intense amusement of the audience,
are very different in character from these poetic effusions. But to
say that, because the average Love-letters are ludicrous, therefore
all Love-letters, to be genuine, must be ludicrous and incoherent,
is the very Bedlam of absurdity. What makes common Love-letters
so laughable is the fact that the writer, previously a paragon
of prosiness, suddenly gets some poetic fancies and tries to put
them into language. But as the writing of poetry—in verse or
prose—is a more difficult art than piano-playing, first attempts
cannot be otherwise than harrowing or amusing. On the other
hand, just as a pianist can never improvise so soulfully as when he
is in love, so a poet will write his best prose in the letters addressed
to his love; the only ludicrous feature being that extravagant and
exclusive admiration of one person which is the very essence of
Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>Surely Hawthorne was neither “insincere” nor “thinking of
posterity” when he finished one of his Love-letters with this poetic
conceit, expressed in his best prose style:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“When we shall be endowed with spiritual bodies I think they
will be so constituted that we may send thoughts and feelings any
distance, in no time at all, and transfuse them warm and fresh into
the consciousness of those we love. Oh, what happiness it would
be, at this moment, if I could be conscious of some purer feeling,
some more delicate sentiment, some lovelier fantasy than could
possibly have had its birth in my own nature, and therefore be
aware that you were thinking through my mind and feeling through
my heart! Perhaps you possess this power already.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This is true epistolary Love-making—the sublimated essence of
complimentary Gallantry.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>LOVE-CHARMS FOR WOMEN</h3>

<p class='c013'>As women are not allowed to make Love actively, they resort
to various cunning arts with which they indirectly reach the hard
hearts of men. Magic is the most potent of these arts, and always
has been so considered by women; for, curiously enough, one finds
on looking over the folklore of various nations, ancient and modern,
that in nineteen cases out of twenty where a Love-charm is spoken
of, it is one used by women to win the affection of men.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>Probably the real reason why the vast majority of women are
so curiously indifferent to the hygienic arts of increasing and preserving
Personal Beauty—as shown in their devotion to tight-lacing,
their aversion to fresh air, sunshine, and brisk exercise—is
because they know they can infallibly win a man’s Love by the use
of some simple powder or potion. It is well known that the
Roman poet Lucretius took his life in an amorous fit caused by a
love-potion; and Lucullus lost his reason in the same way. The
grandest musical work in existence would never have been written
had not Brangäne given to Tristan and Isolde a love-potion which
was so powerful that it made not only both the victims die of the
fever of Love, but united them even after death: "For from the
grave of Tristan sprang a plant which descended into the grave of
Yseult. Cut down thrice by order of the Cornish king, the irrepressible
vegetable bloomed verdant as ever next morning, and
even now casts its shadow over the tombs of the lovers—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘An ay it grew, an ay it threw,</div>
      <div class='line'>As they would fain be one.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In mediæval times Personal Beauty was such a rare thing, and
created such havoc among men, that the unhappy possessors of it
were frequently accused of using forbidden Love-charms, and burnt
at the stake as witches.</p>

<p class='c001'>To-day, thanks to our superior sanitary and educational arrangements,
Beauty is such a common affair that it has lost all its effect
on the masculine heart; hence girls should carefully note a few of
the ways by which a man may be irresistibly fascinated.</p>

<p class='c001'>Italian girls practise the following method: A lizard is caught,
drowned in wine, dried in the sun and reduced to powder, some of
which is thrown on the obdurate man, who thenceforth is theirs
for evermore.</p>

<p class='c001'>A favourite Slavonic device is to cut the finger, let a few drops
of her blood run into a glass of beer, and make the adored man
drink it unknowingly. The same method is current in Hesse and
Oldenburg, according to Dr. Ploss. In Bohemia, the girl who is
afraid to wound her finger may substitute a few drops of bat’s
blood.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cases are known where invocations to the moon were followed
by the bestowal of true Love. And if a girl will address the new
moon as follows—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“All hail to thee, moon! All hail to thee!</div>
      <div class='line'>Prithee, good moon, reveal to me,</div>
      <div class='line'>This night who my husband shall be,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>she will dream of him that very night.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>A four-leaved clover secretly placed in a man’s shoes will make
him the devoted lover of the woman who puts it in.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Inside a frog is a certain crooked bone, which, when cleaned
and dried over the fire on St. John’s Eve, and then ground fine
and given in food to the lover, will at once win his love for the
administerer.”</p>

<p class='c001'>If a girl sees a man washing his hands—say at a picnic—and
lends him her apron or handkerchief to dry them, he will forthwith
declare himself her amorous slave to eternity.</p>

<p class='c001'>There <em>are</em> men, however, who, owing to some constitutional
defect or inherited anomaly, remain unaffected by these and similar
arts. Should any woman be so foolish as to crave such a man’s
Love, she will do well to bear in mind that <em>Vanity is the backdoor
by which every man’s heart may be entered</em>. Thus Byron says
of a Venetian flame of his: “But her great merit is finding out
mine—there is nothing so amiable as discernment.” “Let her be,”
says Thackeray, “if not a clever woman, an appreciator of cleverness
in others, which, perhaps, clever folks like better.” “Ne’er,”
says Scott,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Was flattery lost on poet’s ears:</div>
      <div class='line'>A simple race! they waste their toil</div>
      <div class='line'>For the vain tribute of a smile.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Rousseau’s last love was inspired by a woman’s admiration of his
writings. Balzac, celibate for many years, was at last captured by
a woman who returned to a hotel room for a volume of his works
she had left there, informing him, without suspecting who he was,
that she never travelled without it and could not live without it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The story of the marriage of Lamartine,” says the author of
<cite>Salad for the Solitary</cite>, “is also one of romantic interest. The
lady, whose maiden name was Birch, was possessed of considerable
property, and when past the bloom of youth she became passionately
enamoured of the poet from the perusal of his <cite>Meditations</cite>.
For some time she nursed this sentiment in secret, and, being
apprised of the embarrassed state of his affairs, she wrote him,
tendering him the bulk of her fortune. Touched with this remarkable
proof of her generosity, and supposing it could only be
caused by a preference for himself, he at once made an offer of his
hand and heart. He judged rightly, and the poet was promptly
<a id='corr252.39'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='accepted.'>accepted.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_252.39'><ins class='correction' title='accepted.'>accepted.”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>Sympathy, beauty, wit, elegant manners, amiability—these are
woman’s arrows of Love, ever sure of their aim. “She loved me
for the dangers I had passed,” says Othello, “and I loved her that
she did pity them.” Or, as Professor Dowden comments on this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>passage, “the beautiful Italian girl is fascinated by the regal
strength and grandeur, and tender protectiveness of the Moor.
<em>He</em> is charmed by the sweetness, the sympathy, the gentle disposition
the gracious womanliness of Desdemona.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The <em>gracious womanliness</em> of Desdemona.” There lies the
secret—the charm of charms. It is fortunate that the political
viragoes of to-day, who would remove woman from her domestic
sphere, have opposed to them the greatest force in the universe—<em>the
power of man’s Love!</em> When they have overcome that, they
will find it easy to dam the current of the Niagara River, and curb
the force of the ocean’s countless breakers.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>PROPOSING</h3>

<p class='c013'>Countless as the stars, and only too apposite, are the jokes
about lovers who evolve masterpieces of eloquence wherewith to
lay their hearts at their idol’s feet; but who, when the crucial
moment of the trial arrives, like Beckmesser in Wagner’s comic
opera, stutter out the veriest parody of their song of Love. And
no wonder, considering what is at stake; for the Yes or No decides
whether the lover is to be—literally—the happiest or the unhappiest
of all men for weeks or months to come.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ovid cautions a man not to select a sweetheart in the twilight
or lamplight, since “spots are invisible at night and every fault
is overlooked; at that time almost every woman is held to be
beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But proposing is a different matter from selecting. When once
the choice is made, and her choice alone remains to be decided,
twilight is the only proper time to “pop the question.” For a
maiden’s independence and Coyness are inversely related to the
degree of light. In the morning, in broad daylight, she can boldly
face even the terrible thought of being left an old maid; but in
the twilight she feels the need of a man’s protection, and it is at
that time that the imagination is least deaf to the whispered and
self-suggested fancies of Romantic Love and wedded bliss. A
man who proposes in the morning deserves, therefore, to be disappointed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nature herself has provided a safeguard against morning proposals.
No woman is so beautiful in the daytime as is in the evening;
and the moon’s romantic associations are largely due to its
magic effect of beautifying the complexion and features of women,
and thus urging the lover’s courage to the point of amorous confession.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>There is still another reason why a tender and considerate
lover should propose in the chiaroscuro of subdued light—to spare
her blushes—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But ’neath yon crimson tree,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lover to listening maid might breathe his flame,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor mark, within its roseate canopy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her blush of maiden shame.”—<span class='sc'>Bryant.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Not many years ago a plan was described in the newspapers by
which a number of Southern youths who had not the courage to
propose were happily mated and wedded. An elderly person was
selected, vowed to eternal secrecy, and to him each youth and
maiden who was in love confided in writing the name of the beloved.
Those couples that had chosen one another were informed
of the fact, and went away rejoicing, arm in arm.</p>

<p class='c001'>A fairy story, on the face of it. A woman would sooner cut off
her hand than write with it the secret of her Love before she
knew it was returned; and that man that hath a tongue is, I say,
no man, if he is afraid to ask for a woman’s hand—or to take it
unasked, and let it respond to the touching question. “Love
sought is good, but given unsought is better,” says Shakspere.
The only true proposals are those where spoken words are dispensed
with; where the magnetic thrill of the hands, the eloquence
of the tell-tale eyes, draw the lovers into mutual embrace, and lips
become glued on lips in unpremeditated ecstasy.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>DIAGNOSIS OR SIGNS OF LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Though women may often feel in doubt concerning the intentions
of men who pay them attentions, they cannot help recognizing
deep Love in a man instantly; for the symptoms, as described
in a previous chapter, are absolutely unmistakable. A woman,
too, who loves deeply, can hardly help betraying herself, by the
sly opportunities she finds for meeting her lover (purely accidental,
of course), and by the special pains she takes to make it clear to
her friends that she does not care for <em>that</em> man certainly; often
also by the fact, pointed out by Jean Paul, that “Love increases
man’s delicacy and lessens woman’s”; tempting her occasionally
to throw away all prudence and regard for public opinion, in the
wild intoxication of her passion and her confidence in her lover.</p>

<p class='c001'>But in cases of doubt—how is a lover to decide whether it is
safe and worth while to proceed? A woman’s Coyness, of course,
means nothing, and may have been brought on by an assumption
of excessive confidence and boldness on the man’s part. Girls are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>like wild colts. They may be safely approached to a certain distance,
whence one step more will cause them to stampede; but
stand still at that point, and before long they will cast away fear
and meet you half-way.</p>

<p class='c001'>Trifles are the only safe tests of Love. For they are not so
apt as weighty words and actions to be the outcome of a deliberate
coquettish desire to deceive. To ascertain if you are loved—and
this holds true for both sexes—allude (with a careless assumption
of indifference) to some trifling details of previous conversation or
common experience. If she (or he) remembers them all, especially
if of remote occurrence, the chances are you are loved.</p>

<p class='c001'>Shakspere evidently had this in mind when he wrote—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“If thou rememberest not the slightest folly</div>
      <div class='line'>That ever love did make thee run into,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou hast not loved.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>HOW TO CURE LOVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>All hope abandon ye who enter here. It is a terrible haunt
of pessimism, for disappointed lovers only. All others will please
pass it by, for the object of this book is to advocate the cause of
Love, not to weaken it. Only when all hope of reciprocation is
abandoned, should the tender plant ever be crushed underfoot.</p>

<p class='c001'>An exception must be made in favour of those hopeful lovers
who merely wish to cure themselves in order to improve their
chances of winning, as explained in the last chapter, under the
head of Feigned Indifference.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is useless to quote to a rejected lover Rosalind’s philosophy:
“Our poor world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this
time there was not any man died in his own person, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>videlicet</i></span>, in a
love cause.... Men have died from time to time, and worms
have eaten them, but not for love.” Useless to tell him, as
Emerson does, that it is not a disgrace to love unrequitedly: “It
never troubles the sun that some of his rays fall wide and vain
into ungrateful space, and only a small part on the reflecting
planet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>To all such efforts at consolation the poor wretch may retort
with Shakspere: “Every one may master a grief but he who
has it.” Yet he may, at any rate, endeavour to “patch his
grief” with the following reflections, based on the experience of
centuries.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>ABSENCE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Two thousand years ago Ovid advised the readers of his
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Remedia Amoris</cite></span> who wished to cure themselves of an unwelcome
attachment to flee the capital, to travel, hunt, or till the soil till
all danger of a relapse should he averted. “Out of sight, out of
mind,” wrote Thomas à Kempis; and this theme has been varied
by a hundred writers in prose and verse. “Love is a local
anguish,” exclaims Coleridge; “I am fifty miles away and am not
half so miserable.” Carew puts it thus—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>

      <div class='line'>“Then fly betimes, for only they</div>
      <div class='line'>Conquer love, that run away.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Even the unspeakable Turk has a proverb advising a lover to fly
to the mountains. The Himalayas are probably meant, for no
other chain would be high enough to allay the anguish of a polygamist
rejected by a whole harem.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, “I find that absence still increases love,”
wrote Charles Hopkins in the seventeenth century; and Bayly
gave this paradox the familiar form of “absence makes the heart
grow fonder”—to which a modern realistic wag has added the
coda “of the other man.” “La Rochefoucauld has well remarked,”
says Hume, “that absence destroys weak passions, but increases
strong ones; as the wind extinguishes a candle but blows up a
fire.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This simile is not very appropriate, nor is the statement unquestionable.
It is more correct to say that short absence increases
Love, while long absence cures it.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are two ways in which a short absence favours Love:</p>

<p class='c001'>Like the thirst of a man who would wean himself of strong
liquor, the lovers ardour is at first increased when he is placed
where he can no longer drink in the intoxicating sight of her
beauty. Time is needed to annihilate the maddening memory of
that pleasure.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, short absence favours the idealising process in the
lover’s mind. Removed from the corrective influence of her actual
presence, his imagination may abandon itself to the delightful task
of painting a gloriously unreal counterfeit of her charms—which is
oil in the flames.</p>

<p class='c001'>This idealising process is facilitated by the strange difficulty
which most people—and lovers in particular—experience in recalling
the features of those specially dear to them.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>Given sufficient time to fix the idealised image of the beloved
in the memory, and a cure may be effected through the shock subsequently
felt on comparing this image with the greatly inferior
reality.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>TRAVEL</h3>

<p class='c013'>It is safer, however, not to risk a return, but to avoid sight of
her altogether for several years. The advantages of travel are
twofold, not to mention the security from the danger of an
accidental meeting. At home the surrounding world is too familiar
to afford distraction, whereas in a strange place every object claims
the attention and diverts the mind from its amorous reveries.
More important still is the fact that in a foreign country the
strangeness of national physiognomy invests all women with a
heightened charm, so that it is easier to find an antidote by falling
in love anew.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>EMPLOYMENT</h3>

<p class='c013'>“Great spirits and great business do keep out the weak passion
of love,” said Bacon; but long before him Ovid knew that Leisure
is Cupid’s chief ally. “If you desire to end your love, employ
yourself and you will conquer; for Amor flees business.” He
advises military service, agriculture, and hunting as excellent
diversions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Poetry and music, however, as the same poet tells us, and all
other occupations tending to stir up the tender feelings, are to be
carefully avoided. Novel-reading is particularly bad, for to
imagine another’s Love is to revive your own. “Lotte Hartmann
played some melodies of Bellini on the piano this evening,” writes
Lenau; “I ought to avoid music when I am away from you, for it
arouses in me a longing and an anguish of consuming violence. I
feel how my heart sadly shrinks within itself, and unwillingly
continues to beat.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>MARRIED MISERY</h3>

<p class='c013'>Surely the thought that his romantic adoration will cease with
marriage ought to cure a rejected wooer. Unquestionably, marriage
is the best cure of Love. For though cynics are wrong in claiming
that wedlock changes Love to indifference, it does change it to
conjugal affection, which is an entirely different group of emotions.
To the rejected lover, unfortunately, matrimony is not available as
a cure of his Love. But he may give his overheated imagination
an ice-bath by reflecting on the dark side of conjugal life, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>promised bliss of which has been described as a mirage by so
many great minds.</p>

<p class='c001'>Professor Jowett thus discourses on how a modern Sokrates
in a cynical mood might discourse on the seamy side of married
life:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“How the inferior of the two drags the other down to his or
her level; how the cares of a family ‘breed meanness in their
souls.’... They cannot undertake any noble enterprise, such as
makes the names of men and women famous, from domestic considerations.
Too late their eyes are opened; they were taken
unawares, and desire to part company. Better, he would say, a
‘little love at the beginning,’ for heaven might have increased it;
but now their foolish fondness has changed into mutual dislike....
How much nobler, in conclusion he will say, is friendship,
which does not receive unmeaning praises from novelists and
poets, is not exacting or exclusive, is not impaired by familiarity,
is much less expensive, is not so likely to take offence, seldom
changes, and may be dissolved from time to time without the
assistance of the courts.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr. Johnson, in a letter to Baretti, points out the difference
between Love and Marriage:</p>

<p class='c001'>“In love, as in every other passion of which hope is the
essence, we ought always to remember the uncertainty of events.
There is, indeed, nothing that so much seduces reason from
vigilance as the thought of passing life with an amiable woman;
and if all would happen that a lover fancies, I know not what
other terrestrial happiness would deserve pursuit. But love and
marriage are different states. Those who are to suffer the evils
together, and to suffer often for the sake of one another, <em>soon lose
that tenderness of look</em> and that benevolence of mind which arose
from the participation of unmingled pleasure and successive
amusement.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lose that tenderness of look!” Have you reflected that it is
that exquisite tenderness of look which chiefly fascinated you, and
have you not noticed that, as Johnson implies, married people
rarely regard one another with that look which constantly intoxicated
them during Courtship? For “beauty soon grows familiar
to the lover, fades in his eye, and palls upon the sense,” says
Addison; or, as Hazlitt puts it, “though familiarity may not breed
contempt, it takes off the edge of admiration.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“With most marriages,” says Goethe, “it is not long till things
assume a very piteous look.” Raleigh: “If thou marry beauty,
thou bindest thyself all thy life for that which, perchance, will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>neither last nor please thee one year.” Seneca: “Beauty is such
a fleeting blossom, how can wisdom rely upon its momentary
delight?” Howells: “Marian Butler was at that period full of
those airs of self-abnegation with which women adorn themselves
in the last days of betrothal and the first of marriage, and never
afterwards.” Alexander Walker: “It looks as if woman were in
possession of most enjoyments, and as if man had only an illusion
held out to him to make him labour for her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Montaigne: “As soon as women are ours we are no longer
theirs.” “The land of marriage has this peculiarity that strangers
are desirous of inhabiting it, while its natural inhabitants would
willingly be banished thence.” Boucicault: “I wish that Adam
had died with all his ribs in his body.” De Finod: “Marriage is
the sunset of love.” Goldsmith: “Many of the English marry in
order to have one happy month in their lives.” Hood: “You
can’t wive and thrive both in the same year.” Southey: “There
are three things a wise man will not trust,—the wind, the sunshine
of an April day, and a woman’s plighted faith.” Byron:
“I remarked in my illness the complete inertion, inaction, and
destruction of my chief mental faculties. I tried to rouse them,
and yet could not—and this is the <em>Soul</em>!!! I should believe
that it was married to the body if they did not sympathise so much
with each other.” Colley Cibber: “Oh, how many torments lie in
the small circle of a wedding-ring!” Alphonse Karr: “Women for
the most part do not love us. They do not choose a man because
they love him, but because it pleases them to be loved by him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Lady Montagu: “It goes far toward reconciling me to being a
woman, when I reflect that I am thus in no immediate danger of
ever marrying one.” Schopenhauer: “It is well known that
happy marriages are rare.” “The lover, contrary to expectation,
finds himself no happier than before.” Byron—</p>

<p class='c001'>When the Pope heard of Father Hyacinthe’s marriage, says
Cheales, he exclaimed: “The saints be praised! the renegade has
taken his punishment into his own hands. Truly the ways of
Providence are inscrutable!”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>FEMININE INFERIORITY</h3>

<p class='c013'>Why are women so mysterious, so inscrutable? Cynics say
because you cannot calculate what they will do, as they have no
fixed compass by which they steer, <i>i.e.</i> no character. But Heine
takes up their defence. Far from having no character, he says,
they have a new one every day.</p>

<p class='c001'>The world’s opinion of women is best revealed in the crystallised
wisdom, based on experience, called proverbs. It will soothe the
wounded lover’s heart to note the unanimity with which woman’s
foibles are dwelt on in the proverbs of all nations from ancient
Greece to modern China and France. To give only three instances
of a thousand that may be found in any collection of proverbs:
“Women,” says a French proverb, “have quicksilver in the brain,
wax in the heart.” The old Greek poet Xenarchus sang, “Happy
the cicadas live, since they all have voiceless wives.” “There is
no such poison in the green snake’s mouth or in the hornet’s sting
as in a woman’s heart,” says a Chinese maxim.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it is not necessary to rely on such anonymous collections
of wisdom as proverbs to convince a man of the folly of linking
himself for life with such a miserable inferior being as a woman.
From Plato to Darwin there is a consensus of opinion as to woman’s
vast inferiority to man.</p>

<p class='c001'>According to Plato, says Mr. Grote, “men are superior to
women in everything; in one occupation as well as in another.”
Cookery and weaving having been named as two apparent exceptions,
Plato denies woman’s superiority even in these.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The chief distinction in the intellectual powers of the two
sexes,” says Darwin, “is shown by man’s attaining to a higher
eminence, in whatever he takes up, than can woman—whether
requiring deep thought, reason, or imagination, or merely the use
of the senses and hands. If two lists were made of the most
eminent men and women in poetry, painting, sculpture, music
(inclusive both of composition and performance), history, science,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>and philosophy, with half a dozen names under each subject, the
two lists would not bear comparison.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I found, as a rule,” says Mr. Galton, "that men have more
delicate powers of discrimination than women, and the business of
life seems to confirm this view. The tuners of pianofortes are men,
and so, I understand, are the tasters of tea and wine, the sorters of
wool, and the like. These latter occupations are well salaried,
because it is of the first moment to the merchant that he should
be rightly advised on the real value of what he is about to purchase
or to sell. If the sensitivity of women were superior to that of
men, the self-interest of merchants would lead to their being
always employed; but as the reverse is the case, the opposite supposition
is likely to be the true one.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ladies rarely distinguish the merits of wine at the dinner-table,
and though custom allows them to preside at the breakfast-table,
men think them, on the whole, to be far from successful
makers of tea and coffee.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This disposes of the old myth that women are more sensitive
than men. And De Quincy, in his essay on <cite>False Distinctions</cite>,
refutes the equally absurd notion that “women have more imagination
than men.” He comes to the conclusion that, “as to poetry
in its highest form, I never yet knew a woman, nor yet will believe
that any has existed, who could rise to an entire sympathy with
what is most excellent in that art.”</p>

<p class='c001'>One proof of this statement lies in the fact that as a rule men
of genius have been refused by the women they loved most deeply.</p>

<p class='c001'>Regarding the emotional sphere, we have seen that it is only in
parental and conjugal feeling that woman surpasses man. In
Romantic Love, in all the impersonal feelings for art and nature,
she is vastly his inferior. Her superficial education gives her no
intellectual interests, and that is the reason why so many married
men prefer the club and friendship to home and conjugal devotion—even
as did the ancient Greeks.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is in the seventh book of the <cite>Laws</cite>, p. 806, that Plato
remarks: “The legislator ought not to let the female sex live softly
and waste money and have no order of life, while he takes the
utmost care of the male sex, and leaves half of life only blest with
happiness, when he might have made the whole state happy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Is it not humiliating to man, who loves to call himself a
“reasoning animal,” to find that, after so many centuries, one of
our greatest and most liberal thinkers, Professor Huxley, is obliged
to write in this same Platonic tone that “the present system of
female education stands self-condemned, as inherently absurd,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>because it fosters and exaggerates instead of removing woman’s
natural disadvantages? “With few insignificant exceptions,”
Professor Huxley continues, “girls have been educated either to
be drudges or toys beneath man, or a sort of angels above him;
the highest ideal aimed at oscillating between Clärchen and Beatrice.
The possibility that the ideal of womanhood lies neither in the fair
saint nor in the fair sinner; that women are meant neither to be
men’s guides nor their playthings, but their comrades, their fellows,
and their equals, so far as Nature puts no bar to their equality,
does not seem to have entered into the minds of those who have
had the conduct of the education of girls” (<cite>Lay Sermons</cite>, p. 25).</p>

<p class='c001'>Woman, in short, is a failure; and let any disappointed lover
ask himself, Is it businesslike to begin life with a failure?</p>

<h3 class='c014'>FOCUSSING HER FAULTS</h3>

<p class='c013'>Love being a magic emotional microscope which ignites passion
by magnifying the most beautiful features of the beloved, leaving
everything else indistinct and blurred, it follows that the simplest
way of arresting this flame is to <em>change the focus of this microscope</em>,
to fix the attention deliberately on her faults, while throwing her
merits and charms into an unfavourable light.</p>

<p class='c001'>This method is too self-evident and effective not to have occurred
to the ingenious Ovid. He advises the lover who wishes to be
cured to study the girl’s charms in a hypercritical spirit. Call her
stout if she is plump, black if she is dark, lean if slender. Ask
her to sing if she has no talent for music, to talk if unskilled in
conversation, to dance if awkward, and if her teeth are bad, tell
her funny stories to make her laugh.</p>

<p class='c001'>Her mental faults require no microscope to reveal them. Certainly
her taste is execrable, for does she not prefer that vulgar
fellow Jones to you, one of the cleverest fellows that ever condescended
to be born on this miserable planet?</p>

<p class='c001'>What folly, indeed, to love such a girl! What fascinates you
is simply the mysterious brilliancy of her coal-black eyes—of which
you may find ten thousand duplicates in Italy or Spain. Don’t
you see that no flashes of wit are ever mirrored in those eyes?
that, though beautiful, they are soulless, like a black pansy? that
they look at one person as at another, incapable of expressing
shades and modulations of tender emotion, because the soul of
which they are the windows has never been, and never will be,
moved by Love?</p>

<p class='c001'>She never thinks of anything but her own pleasure; does
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>nothing but visit the dressmaker and the theatre and read novels;
never thinks it her duty to provide for her future husband’s comfort
and happiness by educating herself in domestic economy and
æsthetic accomplishments of real depth—as you have toiled and
studied in anticipation of providing for her comfort and happiness.
She takes no sympathetic interest in your affairs—how can you
expect to be happy with her? If she loves you not, you would be
more than a fool to try to get her consent to marriage, for is it not
the ecstasy of Love to be loved and worshipped alone and beyond
any other mortal?</p>

<p class='c001'>The beauty of her eyes will not last,—it is nothing, anyway,
but sunlight mechanically reflected from a darkly-painted iris—and
when its youthful brilliancy vanishes there will be no soul-sparks
to take its place. And for this brief honeymoon mirage you are
willing to give up your bachelor comforts and pleasures, your
freedom to do what you please, go where you please, and travel
whenever you please; to exchange your refreshing sleep o’ nights
for domestic cares and the pleasure of trotting up and down the
room with a bawling baby at two o’clock in the morning? Bah!
Are you in your senses?</p>

<p class='c001'>True, if you are rich some of these disadvantages may be
avoided. But if you are rich you will not be refused, for—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Mammon wins his way where seraphs might despair,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>as Byron remarks; and again: “For my own part, I am of the
opinion of Pausanias, that success in love depends upon <em>Fortune</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But of all her shortcomings the most galling and fatal is that
she loves you not. This thought alone, says Stendhal, may succeed
in curing a man of his passion. You will notice, he says,
that she whom you love favours others with little attentions which
she withholds from you. They may be mere trifles, such as not
giving you a chance to help her into her carriage, her box at the
opera. The thought of this, by “associating a sense of humiliation
with every thought of her, poisons the source of love and may
destroy it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus wounded Pride is the easiest way out of Love, as gratified
Pride is the straightest way in.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>REASON <i>VERSUS</i> PASSION</h3>

<p class='c013'>According to Shakspere, though Love does not admit Reason as
his counsellor, he <em>does</em> use him as his physician. The most effective
way of using Reason to cure Love is by way of comparison. By
dwelling on the miseries of married life as just detailed, the disappointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>lover may mitigate his pains somewhat, as did that Italian
mentioned by Schopenhauer, who resisted the agony of torture by
constantly keeping in his mind’s eye the picture of the gallows
that would have been the reward of confession.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, he may compare his present Love with a former infatuation
that seemed at the time equally deep and eternal, though now
he wonders how he could have <em>ever</em> loved that girl. History
repeats itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>Compare, moreover, your present idol with her stout and faded
mother. In a few years she will perhaps resemble her mother more
than her present self.</p>

<p class='c001'>Compare her charms, feature by feature, with some recognised
paragon of beauty. Look at her in the glaring light of the sun,
which reveals every spot on the complexion.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>LOVE <i>VERSUS</i> LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Longfellow says it is folly to pretend that one ever wholly
recovers from a disappointed passion; and Mr. Hamerton believes
that “a wrinkled old maid may still preserve in the depths of her
own heart, quite unsuspected by the young and lively people about
her, the unextinguished embers of a passion that first made her
wretched fifty years before.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Occasionally this may be true, in the sense in which psychology
teaches that no impression made on the mind is ever completely
effaced, but may, though forgotten for years, be revived in moments
of great excitement, or in the delirium of fever; as, for example,
in the case mentioned by Duval, of a Pole in Germany, who had
not used his native language for thirty years, but who, under the
influence of anæsthetics, “spoke, prayed, and sang, using only the
Polish language.” The persistence of an old passion is the more
probable from the fact that in mental disease and age, as Ribot
points out, the emotional faculties are effaced much more slowly
than the intellectual. Feelings form the self; <em>amnesia</em> of feeling
is the destruction of self.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ordinarily, however, and for the time being, it may be possible
to practically obliterate a passion. “All love may be expelled by
love, as poisons are by other poisons,” says Dryden. And if the
allopathic remedies described in the preceding paragraphs should
fail to effect a cure, the lover may find the hom&oelig;opathic principle
of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>similia similibus</i></span> more successful.</p>

<p class='c001'>Heine, in his posthumous Memoirs, thus refers to this principle
of curing like with like:—</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>“In love, as in the Roman Catholic religion, there is a
provisional purgatory in which mortals are allowed to get used
gradually to being roasted before they get into the real eternal
hell.... In all honesty, what a terrible thing is love for a
woman. Inoculation is herein of no use.... Very wise and
experienced physicians counsel a change of locality in the opinion
that removal from the presence of the enchantress will also break
the charm. Perhaps the hom&oelig;opathic principle, by which woman
cures us of woman, is the best of all.... It was ordained that I
should be visited more severely than other mortals by this malady,
the heart-pox.... The most effective antidote to women are
women; true, this implies an attempt to expel Satan with Beelzebub;
and in such a case the medicine is often more noxious still
than the malady. But it is at any rate a change, and in a
disconsolate love-affair a change of the inamorata is unquestionably
the best policy.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>PROGNOSIS OR CHANCES OF RECOVERY</h3>

<p class='c013'>After carefully following all the foregoing rules regarding
absence, travel, employment, dwelling on the miseries of marriage,
the weaknesses of women in general and one woman in particular,
the disappointed lover may boldly return and face her again.
The chances are ten to one he will find himself—more in love
than ever!</p>

<p class='c001'>Women are magicians. No wonder they were burned as witches
in the Middle Ages.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>NATIONALITY AND LOVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Romantic love—commonly considered immutable—not only
displays countless individual variations in regard to duration and
degrees of intensity, but has a sort of “local colour” in each
country; or, to keep up our old metaphor, a varying clangtint,
depending on the greater or less prominence of certain “overtones.”</p>

<p class='c001'>To describe all these varieties of Love would require a separate
volume. And since all the most interesting forms of the romantic
passion are to be met with in France, Italy, Spain, Germany,
England, and America, it will suffice to briefly characterise Love
in those countries.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>FRENCH LOVE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>As literary luck would have it, the subject of French Love
follows naturally upon the subject of the last chapter, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Remedia
Amoris</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The French are too clever a nation to leave to individual effort
the difficult task of curing the mind of such an obstinate thing as
Love. All the papas and mammas in the land have put their
heads together and devised two methods of <em>killing Love wholesale</em>,
compared with which all the remedies named in the last chapter
are mere fly-bites.</p>

<p class='c001'>These two methods are Chaperonage and Parental Choice, as
opposed to Courtship and Individual Sexual Selection.</p>

<p class='c001'>Paradoxical as it may seem, there is in the midst of modern
Europe a nation which, in the treatment of women, Love, and
marriage, stands on the same low level of evolution as the ancient,
mediæval, and Oriental nations.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is not a theory, but a fact patent to all, and attested by
the best English, German, and French authors.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the deepest of French thinkers, whose eyes were opened
by travel and comparison, De Stendhal, in 1842, says in his book
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>De l’Amour</cite></span>: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Pour comprendre cette passion, que depuis trente
ans la peur du ridicule cache avec tant de soin parmi nous, il faut
en parler comme d’une maladie”</span>—"To understand this passion,
which during the last thirty years has been concealed among us
with so much solicitude, from fear of ridicule, it is necessary to
speak of it as a malady."</p>

<p class='c001'>But Stendhal greatly understates the case. It was not only
within thirty years from the time when he wrote, and by means
of ridicule, that the French had tried hard to kill Love. They
have never really emancipated themselves from mediæval barbarism.
Pure Romantic Love between two young unmarried persons has
never yet flourished in France—because it has never been allowed
to grow. To-day, as in the days of the Troubadours, the only
form of Love celebrated in French plays and romances is the form
which implies conjugal infidelity.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Marriage, as treated in the old French epics,” says Ploss, “is
rarely based on love;” the woman marries for protection, the man
for her wealth or social affiliations. In the eighteenth century
girls were compelled from their earliest years to live only for
appearance sake: “The most harmless natural enjoyment, every
childish ebullition, is interdicted as improper. Her mother denies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>her the expression of tender emotion as too bourgeois, too common.
The little one grows up in a dreary, heartless vacuum; her deeper
feelings remain undeveloped.... Real love would be too ordinary
a motive of marriage, and therefore extremely ridiculous. It is not
offered her, accordingly, nor does she feel any.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Heine wrote from Paris in 1837 that “girls never fall in love
in this country.” "With us in Germany, as also in England and
other nations of Germanic origin, young girls are allowed the
utmost possible liberty, whereas married women become subjected
to the strict and anxious supervision of their husbands.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Here in France, as already stated, the reverse is the case:
young girls remain in the seclusion of a convent until they either
marry or are introduced to the world under the strict eye of a
relative. In the world, <i>i.e.</i> in the French salon, they always
remain silent and little noticed, for it is neither good form here nor
wise to make love to an unmarried girl.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There lies the difference. We Germans, as well as our
Germanic neighbours, bestow our love always on unmarried girls,
and these only are celebrated by our poets; among the French, on
the other hand, married women only are the object of love, in life
as well as in literature.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The difficulty of becoming acquainted with a young lady,
Mr. Hamerton tells us, is greatest “in what may be called the
‘respectable’ classes in country-towns and their vicinities. In
Parisian society young ladies go out into <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>le monde</i></span>, and may be
seen and even spoken to at evening-parties.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And even spoken to” is good, is very good. What a privilege
for the young men! The iron bars which formerly separated
them from the young ladies have actually been removed, and they
are allowed to speak to them—in presence of a heart-chilling,
conversation-killing dragon. No wonder Parisian society is so
corrupt!</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Hamerton has given in <cite>Round My House</cite> the most realistic
and fascinating account of French courtship and marriage-customs
ever written. He is a great admirer of the French, always ready
to excuse their foibles, and his testimony is, therefore, doubly
valuable as that of an absolutely impartial witness. He had an
opportunity for many years of studying French provincial life with
an artist’s trained faculties; and here are a few sentences culled
from his descriptions:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is not merely difficult, in our neighbourhood, for a young
man in the respectable classes to get acquainted with a young lady,
but <em>every conceivable arrangement is devised to make it absolutely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>impossible</em>. Balls and evening-parties are hardly ever given, and
when they are given great care is taken to keep young men out of
them, and young marriageable girls either dance with each other
or with mere children.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Whereas in England “a young girl may go where she likes,
without much risk to her good name,” a French girl “may not
cross a street alone, nor open a book which has not been examined,
nor have an opinion about anything.” “The French ideal of a
well-brought-up young lady is that she should not know anything
whatever about love and marriage, that she should be both innocent
and ignorant, and both in the supreme degree—both to a degree
which no English person can imagine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The young men are not to blame; they would be ready enough,
perhaps, to fall in love if they had the chance, like any Englishman
or German, but the respectable parents of the young lady take care
that they shall <em>not</em> have the chance of falling in love.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The only opportunity a young man has of seeing a girl is at a
distance, at church or in a religious procession. Here he may see
her face; her character he can only ascertain through gossip, a
lady friend, or the parish priest. It is much more respectable,
however, to show no such curiosity, for its absence implies the
absence of such a ridiculous thing as Love. “<em>There is nothing
which good society in France disapproves of so much as the passion
of Love</em>, or anything resembling it.” “When C&oelig;lebs asks for the
hand of a girl he has seen for a minute, he may just possibly be in
love with her, which is a degrading supposition; but if he has
never seen her, you cannot even suspect him of a sentiment so
unbecoming.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There is but one way for the young man to gain admission to a
house where there is a marriageable young lady: “He must first,
through a third party, ask to marry the young lady, and, if her
<em>parents</em> consent, he will then be admitted to see her and speak to
her, but not otherwise. <em>The respectable order of affairs is that
the offer and acceptance should precede and not follow courtship.</em>”</p>

<p class='c001'>Would it be possible to conceive a more diabolically ingenious
social machinery for massacring Romantic Love <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>en gros</i></span>?</p>

<p class='c001'>“Marriages in France are generally arranged by the exercise of
reason and prudence, rather than by either passion or affection.”
Mr. Hamerton gives an amusing account of how he was asked to
be matrimonial ambassador by a young man who had never seen
the girl he wanted to marry. Mr. Hamerton obliged the young
man, but was told by the mother that if the young man would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>wait two years he might have a fair chance, provided a <em>richer</em> or
<em>nobler</em> suitor did not turn up in the meantime.</p>

<p class='c001'>Money and Rank <i>versus</i> Love. French mammas have at least
one virtue. They are not hypocrites.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Countess von Bothmer, who lived in France a quarter of a
century, says in her <cite>French Home Life</cite>: “Where we so ordinarily
listen to what we understand by love—to the temptations of the
young heart in all their forms (however transitory), to our individual
impressions and our own opinions—the French consult fitness of
relative situation, reciprocities of fortune and position, and harmonies
of family intercourse.”</p>

<p class='c001'>To annihilate the last resource of Love—elopement—the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Code
Napoléon</cite></span> forbids all marriages without either the consent of the
father and mother, or proof that they are both dead. “It is very
troublesome to get married in France; the operation is surrounded
by difficulties and formalities which would make an Englishman
stamp with rage.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Social life, of course, suffers as much from this idiotic system
as Romantic Love. French hospitality “does not extend beyond
the family circle,” we are informed by M. Max O’Rell, who also
gives this amusing instance of the imbecility or mental slavery
(he does not use these words) produced by the French system of
education and chaperonage:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“I remember I was one day sitting in the Champs Elysées
with two English ladies. Beside us was a young French girl with
her father and mother. The person on the right of papa rose and
went away, and we heard the young innocent say to her mother:
‘Mamma, may I go and sit by papa?’ It was a baby of about
eighteen or twenty. Those English ladies laugh over the affair
to this day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Boys suffer as well as girls. As the author of an article on
“Parisian Psychology” remarks: “There are no mothers in
France; it is a nation of ‘mammas,’ who, in the most unlimited
sense of the word, spoil their boys, weaken them in body and
soul, dwarf their thought, dry their hearts, and lower them to
below even their own level, hoping thereby to rule over them
through life, as they too often do. Frenchwomen having been
at best but half-wives, regard their children as a sort of compensation
for what they have themselves not had; and after the
mischievous fashion of weak ‘mammas’ prolong babyhood till far
into mature life.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The French, in fact, are a nation of babies. Their puerile
conceit, which prevents them from learning to read any language
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>but their own, and thus finding out what other nations think of
them, is responsible in part for the mediæval barbarism of their
matrimonial arrangements. The Parisian is the most provincial
animal in the world. In any other metropolis—be it London,
New York, Vienna, or Berlin—people understand and relish
whatever is good in literature, art, and life, be it English,
American, French, German, or Italian. But the Parisian understands
only what is narrowly and exclusively French. And this
is the dictionary definition of Provincialism.</p>

<p class='c001'>The consequences of this mediævalism and provincialism in
modern France are thus eloquently summed up by a writer in the
<cite>Westminster Review</cite> (1877):—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Such education as girls receive is not only not a preparation
for the wedded state, it is a positive disqualification for it. They
are not taught to read, they are not taught to reason; they are
<em>launched into life without a single intellectual interest</em>. The
whole effort of their early training goes to fill their mind with
puerilities and superstitions. As regards God, they are instructed
to believe in relics and old bones; as regards man, they are
instructed to believe in dress, in mannerisms, and coquetry.
Their love of appreciation, after being enormously developed, is
bottled up and tied down until a husband is found to draw the
cork. What else, then, can we look for but an explosion of
frivolity? Can we expect that such a provision of coquettishness
will be reserved for the husband’s exclusive use? He will be
tired of it in three months—unless it is tired of him before; and
then the pent-up waters will forsake their narrow bed and overflow
the country far and wide.”</p>

<p class='c001'>No wonder Napoléon remarked that “Love does more harm
than good.” And right he was, most emphatically, for the only
kind of Love <em>possible</em> in France does infinite harm. It poisons
life and literature alike.</p>

<p class='c001'>We can now understand the fierceness of Dumas’s attacks on
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>mariages de convenance</i></span>: “The manifest deterioration of the
race touches him; it does not touch us. Nor do we at all realise
the next to impossibility of a man ever marrying for love in
France. There are those who have tried to do it, but they can
never get on in life; they are reputed of ‘bad example’” (<cite>St.
James’s Gazette</cite>).</p>

<p class='c001'>And now we come upon a paradox which has puzzled a great
many thinkers. The Countess von Bothmer, while deploring the
absence of Love in French courtship, endeavours to show that
domestic happiness and conjugal affection are, nevertheless, not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>rare in France. French husbands “are ordinarily with their
wives, accompany them wherever they can, and share their friendships
and distractions.” Mr. Hamerton likewise bears witness
that French girls “become excellent wives, faithful, orderly,
dutiful, contented, and economical. They all either love their
husbands, <em>or conduct themselves as if they did so</em>.” He says the
notion fostered by novels “that Frenchmen are always occupied
in making love to their neighbours’ wives” is nonsense; that
there is no more adultery than elsewhere. “There exists in
foreign countries, and especially in England, a belief that Frenchwomen
are very generally adulteresses. The origin of the belief
is this,— the manner in which marriages are generally managed
in France leaves no room for interesting love-stories. Novelists
and dramatists <em>must</em> find love-stories somewhere, and so they have
to seek for them in illicit intrigues.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This is all very ingenious, but the argument is not conclusive.
Even granted for a moment that Mr. Hamerton is right in his
defence of French conjugal life, is it not a more than sufficient
condemnation of the French system of “courtship” that one-half
of the nation are prevented from reading its literature because it
is so foul and filthy—because Love has been made synonymous
with adultery?</p>

<p class='c001'>But Mr. Hamerton’s assertion loses its probability when viewed
in the light of the following considerations. He himself admits
that the French are anxious to read about Love, that the novelists
and dramatists <em>must</em> find stories of Love somewhere—mind you,
not of conjugal but of Romantic Love—and the Paris <cite>Figaro</cite> not
long ago denounced the French novelists of the period for devoting
their stories to Love almost exclusively, whereas Balzac, Dumas,
Thackeray, and Scott, at least introduced various other matters of
interest. Now French novels have the largest editions of any
books published; and if so vast an interest is displayed by the
French in reading about Love, is it likely that their interest is
purely literary? Certainly not. They will seek it in real life.
And in real life it can only be found in one sphere, which elsewhere
is protected against such invasions, by the young being
allowed to meet one another. “It is to be feared that they who
marry where they do not love, will love where they do not <a id='corr271.38'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='marry.’'>marry.’”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_271.38'><ins class='correction' title='marry.’'>marry.’”</ins></a></span>
In <em>this</em> respect human nature is the same the world over. The
testimony of scores of unprejudiced authors on this head cannot
be ignored.</p>

<p class='c001'>This, however, is only one of the evils following from the
French suppression of pre-matrimonial Love. The parents may or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>may not suffer through conjugal jealousy and infidelity, one thing
is certain,—that the children suffer from it, in body and mind.
It is leading to the depopulation of France. It was M. Jules
Rochard who called attention to the fact that “France, which two
centuries ago included one-third of the total population of Europe,
now contains but one-tenth”; although the death-rate is smaller
in France than in most European countries, and although there
has been a gradual increase of wealth throughout the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>That the suppression of Romantic Love and of all opportunities
for courtship is the principal cause of the decline of France, is
apparent from the fact that the countries in which population
increases most rapidly—as America and Great Britain—are those
in which Romantic Love is the chief motive to marriage.</p>

<p class='c001'>Romantic Love goes by complementary qualities, the defects
of the parents neutralising one another in the offspring; so that
the children who are the issue of a love-match are commonly more
beautiful than their parents. In France there is no selection
whatever, except with reference to money and rank. Not even
Health is considered, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sine qua non</i></span> of Love as well as Beauty.
Hence the absence of Love in France has led to the almost
absolute absence of beauty. And it would be nothing short of a
miracle if the offspring of a young maiden, still in her teens, and
an old broken-down sinner, chosen by her parents for his wealth
or social position, were any different from the puny, hairy men and
coarse-featured, vulgar women that make up the bulk of the
French nation.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Paris one does occasionally see a fine figure and a rather
pretty face, but they almost always belong to the lower classes.
As the lower classes allow the young considerable freedom, it
would seem as if beauty in this class ought to be as common an
article as in England or the United States. But the incapacity
of the young women for feeling and reciprocating Love neutralises
these opportunities. For of what use is it for a man to feel Love
if the woman invariably bases her choice on money? This matter
is most clearly brought out by Mr. Hamerton:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Amongst the lower classes, the peasantry and workmen ...
girls have as much freedom as they have in England. The great
institution of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>parlement</i></span> gives them ample opportunities for
becoming acquainted with their lovers; indeed the acquaintance,
in many cases, goes further than is altogether desirable. A
peasant girl requires no parental help in looking after her own
interests. She admits a lover to the happy state of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>parlement</i></span>,
which means that he has a right to talk with her when they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>meet, and to call upon her, dance with her, etc. The lover is
always eager to fix the wedding-day, the girl is not so eager. She
keeps him on indefinitely until a richer one appears, on which
No. 1 has the mortification of seeing himself excluded from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>parlement</i></span>,
whilst another takes his place. In this way a clever girl
will go on for several years, amusing herself by torturing amorous
swains, until at length a sufficiently big fish nibbles at the bait,
when she hooks him at once, and takes good care that <em>he</em> shall
not escape. Nothing can be more pathetically ludicrous than the
condition of a young peasant who is really in love, especially if he
is able to write, for then he pours forth his feelings in innumerable
letters full of tenderness and complaint. On her part the
girl does not answer the letters, and has not the slightest pity for
the unhappy victim of her charms. After seeing a good deal of
such love-affairs I have come to the conclusion that in humble
life young men do really very often feel</p>

<p class='c013'>Schopenhauer pointed out that the French lack the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Gefühl
für das Innige</cite></span>—the tenderness and emotional depth which
characterise the Germans and Italians. It is this that accounts
for the inability of the French to appreciate Love, and for the fact
that even vice is coarser in France than elsewhere, as remarked by
Mr. Lecky, who, in his <cite>History of European Morals</cite>, contrasts “the
coarse, cynical, ostentatious sensuality, which forms the most
repulsive feature of the French character,” with “the dreamy,
languid, and æsthetical sensuality of the Spaniard or Italian.”
And it remained for the French to attempt to deify vice as in that
over-rated and repulsive story of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Manon Lescaut</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mme. de Staël, who suffered so much from the provincialism
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>alias</i></span> patriotism) of her countrymen, saw clearly the immorality
of the French system of marrying girls without consulting their
choice. Brandes relates the following anecdote of her: “One
day, speaking of the unnaturalness of marriages arranged by the
parents, as distinguished from those in which the young girls
choose for themselves, she exclaimed, ‘I would <em>compel</em> my daughter
to marry the man of her choice!’”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>An attempt is being made at present in Paris to introduce the
Anglo-American feminine spirit into society. The word <em>flirter</em> has
been adopted, and the thing itself experimented with. But the
French girl does not know how to draw the line between coquetry
and flirtation. She needs a better education before she can flirt
properly. This education the Government is trying to give her at
present; but it meets with stubborn resistance from the priests,
and from the old notion that intellectual culture is fatal to feminine
charms and the capacity for affection. If this book should accomplish
nothing else than prove that without intellect there can be
no deep Love, it will not have been written in vain.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>ITALIAN LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>In Italy, in the sixteenth century, women were kept in as
strict seclusion as to-day in France; and with the same results,—conjugal
infidelity and a great lack of Personal Beauty, as noted
by Montaigne, who remarks at the same time that it was regarded
as something quite extraordinary if a young lady was seen in
public.</p>

<p class='c001'>Byron wrote in 1817 that “Jealousy is not the order of the
day in Venice”; and that the Italians “marry for their parents,
and love for themselves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In Crowe and Cavalcaselle’s <cite>Life and Times of Titian</cite> we read
that “Though chroniclers have left us to guess what the state of
society may have been in Venice at the close of the fifteenth
century, they give us reason to believe that it was deeply influenced
by Oriental habit. The separation of men from women in
churches, the long seclusion of unmarried females in convents or in
the privacy of palaces, were but the precursors to marriages in
which husbands were first allowed to see their wives as they came
in state to dance round the wedding supper-table.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But even at this early period when women were still treated as
babies unable to take care of themselves, we find at least one
trace of the Gallantry which is so essential an element in modern
love. It was customary for the men, on festive occasions, to
stand behind their wives’ chairs at table and serve them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Extremely ungallant, on the other hand, are some of the Italian
proverbs about women of this and other periods. “A woman is
like a horse-chestnut—beautiful outside, worthless inside.” “Two
women and a goose make a market.” “Married man—bird in
cage.” “In buying a horse and taking a wife shut your eyes and
commend your soul to heaven.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>Her exuberant health makes an Italian woman naturally prone
to Love; but though she falls in love most readily, the passion is
apt to be fugitive and superficial. She rarely loves with the
passionate ardour of a Spanish woman. “What we notice especially
in Italian women,” says Schweiger-Lerchenfeld, “is the
absence of that alternation between those extremes of temperament
which are so conspicuous in other Southern women. Energy
is almost as unknown to her as the moral power of resignation
and sacrifice. Hence it can hardly surprise us that Italian history
records so few heroic women or pious female martyrs. Italy has
produced neither a Jeanne d’Arc nor an Elizabeth of Thuringia;
the crowns were too oppressive to be borne by these beauties, and
life too enchanting for them to invite to tragic self-sacrifice.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Probably the most realistic, and certainly the most fascinating,
account of Italian love-making ever given is to be found in Mr.
Howells’s <cite>Venetian Life</cite>. As it is too long to quote, I will
attempt to condense it, though at some sacrifice of that literary
“bouquet,” as an epicure would say, which constitutes the unique
charm of Mr. Howells’s style:—</p>

<p class='c001'>"The Venetians have had a practical and strictly businesslike
way of arranging marriages from the earliest times. The shrewdest
provision has always been made for the dower and for the good of
the state; private and public interest being consulted, the small
matters of affection have been left to the chances of association.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Herodotus relates that the Assyrian Veneti sold their
daughters at auction to the highest bidder; and the fair being
thus comfortably placed in life, the hard-favoured were given to
whomsoever would take them, with such dower as might be considered
a reasonable compensation. The auction was discontinued
in Christian times, but marriage contracts still partook of the
form of a public and half-mercantile transaction.</p>

<p class='c001'>“These passionate, headlong Italians look well to the main
chance before they leap into matrimony, and you may be sure
Todaro knows, in black and white, what the Biondina has to her
fortune before he weds her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“With the nobility and with the richest commoners marriage
is still greatly a matter of contract, and is arranged without much
reference to the principals, though it is now scarcely probable in
any case that they have not seen each other. But with all other
classes, except the poorest, who cannot or will not seclude the
youth of either sex from each other, and with whom, consequently,
romantic contrivance and subterfuge would be superfluous, love is
made to-day in Venice as in the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>Capa y espada</i></span> comedies of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>Spaniards, and the business is carried on with all the cumbrous
machinery of confidants, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>billets-doux</i></span>, and stolen interviews.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The “operatic method of courtship” thence resulting commonly
assumes this form:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“They follow that beautiful blonde, who, marching demurely
in front of the gray-moustached papa and the fat mamma, after
the fashion in Venice, is electrically conscious of pursuit. They
follow during the whole evening, and, at a distance, softly follow
her home, where the burning Todaro photographs the number of
the house upon the sensitised tablets of his soul. This is the first
step in love: he has seen his adored one, and she knows that he
loves her with an inextinguishable ardour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The next step consists in his frequenting the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>caffé</i></span>, where she
goes with her parents, and feasting his eyes on her beauty. After
some time he may possibly get a chance to speak a few words to
her under her balcony; or, what is more likely, he will bribe her
servant-maid to bring her a love-letter. Or else he goes to church
to admire her at a convenient distance.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It must be confessed that if the Biondina is not pleased with
his looks, his devotion must assume the character of an intolerable
bore to her; and that to see him everywhere at her heels—to
behold him leaning against the pillar near which she kneels at
church, the head of his stick in his mouth, and his attitude carefully
taken with a view to captivation—to be always in deadly
fear lest she shall meet him in promenade, or turning round at
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>caffé</i></span> encounter his pleading gaze—that all this must drive the
Biondina to a state bordering upon blasphemy and finger-nails.
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Ma, come si fa? Ci vuol pazienza?</i></span> This is the sole course open
to ingenuous youth in Venice, where confessed and unashamed
acquaintance between young people is extremely difficult; and so
this blind pursuit must go on till the Biondina’s inclinations are
at last laboriously ascertained.” Then follow the inquiries as to
her dowry, after which nothing remains but “to demand her in
marriage of her father, <em>and after that to make her acquaintance</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Topsy-turvy as this last arrangement may seem to Anglo-American
notions, here at least Love has some chance to bring
about real Sexual Selection, for a Southerner’s passions are momentarily
inflamed, and the Italian Cupid needs but a moment to fix
his choice. And what distinguishes Italy still more favourably
from France is that, whereas the French consider Love ridiculous,
and have made the most ingenious contrivances for annihilating it,
the Italians worship it, revel in it, and are inclined rather to make
too many concessions to it than to ignore it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>The result is patent to all eyes. For every attractive Frenchwoman
there are to-day a hundred beautiful Italians. And were
Anglo-American methods of courtship introduced in Italy, beauty
would again be doubled in amount. It must not be forgotten,
however, that Love, as a beautifier of mankind, has in Italy very
strong allies in the balmy air and sunshine, tempting to constant
outdoor life, which mellows the complexion, brightens the eyes,
and fills out the figure to those full yet elegant proportions which
instantaneously arouse the romantic passion.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>SPANISH LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Spanish veins contain more Oriental blood than those of any
other European nation; and to the present day Eastern methods
of treating women cast their shadow on Spanish life. But the
shadow is so light, and so much mitigated by the rosy hue of
romance, that the “local colour” of Love in Spain presents an
unusually fascinating spectacle, which countless literary artists
have attempted to depict.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the Oriental
shadow was much darker, and kept the women in extreme subjection
and ignorance. “Their life,” says Professor Scherr, speaking
even of the queens, “passed away in a luxurious tedium which
dulled the sentiments to the point of idiocy. They were only
crowned slaves. As an instance of their absolute deprivation of
liberty may be cited the case of Elizabeth, wife of Philip II., who,
when in 1565 she went to Bayonne to meet her mother, had to
wait three days before the gates of Burgos before it was possible
to ascertain the king’s decision whether the queen should pass
through the city or around it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Women of rank,” he continues, "lived in a seclusion bordering
on that of a convent, if not surpassing it. For nuns were
at least allowed to speak to male visitors behind bars, whereas
married women were strictly forbidden to receive the visit of a
man, except with the special permission of the husband. And
only during the first year of their wedded life were they allowed
to frequent public drives in open carriages by the side of their
husband; subsequently they were only allowed to go out in closed
carriages. Of cosy family life not a trace.... Even the table
did not unite the husband and wife; the master took his meal
alone, while his wife and children sat respectfully on the floor on
carpets, with their legs crossed in Oriental fashion.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The poor women, excluded from every refined social diversion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>were confined to manual work, gossip with their duennas, mechanical
praying, playing with their rosaries, and—intriguing. For the
greater the subjection of women, the more does their cunning
grow, the more passionate becomes their desire to avenge themselves
on their tyrants. The Spaniards found this out to their
cost. The most inexorable spirit of revenge, all the parade of
‘Spanish honour,’ bordering in its excess on clownishness, could
not prevent the Spanish dames from loving and being loved.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In course of time this Oriental despotism, with its fatal consequences
to conjugal fidelity—as in France—has been greatly
mitigated in Spain. In Pepys’s <cite>Diary</cite>, 1667, we read of an
informant who told the writer “of their wooing [in Spain] by
serenades at the window, and that their friends do always make
the match; but yet they have opportunities to meet at masse at
church, and there they make love.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In an interesting book on Spain, written almost two and a
quarter centuries after Pepys’s <cite>Diary</cite>—Mr. Lathrop’s <cite>Spanish
Vistas</cite>—we still read concerning this ecclesiastic Love-making, in
the Seville Cathedral: “Every door was guarded by a squad of
the decrepit army, so that entrance there became a horror. These
sanctuary beggars serve a double purpose, however. The black-garbed
Sevillan ladies, who are perpetually stealing in and out
noiselessly under cover of their archly-draped lace veils—losing
themselves in the dark, incense-laden interior, or emerging from
confession into the daylight glare again—are careful to drop some
slight conscience-money into the palms that wait. Occasionally,
by pre-arrangement, one of these beggars will convey into the
hand that passes him a silver piece, a tightly-folded note from
some clandestine lover. It is a convenient underground mail, and
I am afraid the venerable church innocently shelters a good many
little transactions of this kind.”</p>

<p class='c001'>How greatly the facilities for falling in love and for making
love have been increased in modern Spain is vividly brought out
in the following citation from Schweiger-Lerchenfeld regarding the
scenes to be witnessed every evening on the crowded promenade
or Rambla at Barcelona:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Are these elegantly-attired ramblers one and all suitors, since
they put no limit nor restraint on their whispered flatteries? No,
that is simply the custom in Barcelona. The women and girls
are beautiful, and though they are well aware of it, they nevertheless
allow their charms to be whispered in their ears hundreds of
times every evening—a freedom of intercourse which is only
possible on Spanish soil.... And thus one of these adored
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>beauties walks up and down in the glare of the lamps, and sweet
music is wafted to her ears: ‘Your beauty dazzles me,’ whispers
one voice; and another, ‘Happiness and anguish your eyes are
burning into my soul.’ One compliments the chosen one on her
hair, another on her figure, a third on her graceful gait. Young
adorers feel a thrill running down their whole body if her mantilla
only touches them; while mature lovers are contented with nothing
less than a pressure of the hand. It is a picture that is possible,
conceivable only in Spain.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The same writer quotes some specimens of Spanish Love-songs,
one of which may be transferred to this page—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">“Échame, niña bonita,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Lágrimas en tu pañuelo,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Y los llevaré a Madrid</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Que los engarce un platero.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“Show me, my little charmer, the tear in your handkerchief; to
Madrid will I take it and have it set by a jeweller.”</p>

<p class='c001'>What a contrast between this modern complimentary and
poetic form of Gallantry and the form prevalent in the good old
times when lovers endeavoured to win a maiden’s favour by flagellating
themselves under her window until the blood ran down
their backs; and when, as Scherr adds, “it was regarded as the
surest sign of supreme gallantry if some of the blood bespattered
the clothes of the beauty to whom this crazy act of devotion was
addressed!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless, the Spanish still have much to learn from England
and America regarding the proper methods of Courtship; for,
according to a writer in <cite>Macmillan’s Magazine</cite> (1874), the unmarried
maiden of the higher classes, “like her humbler sister,
can never have the privilege of seeing her lover in private, and
very rarely, indeed, if ever, is he admitted into the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>sala</i></span> where
she is sitting. He may contrive to get a few minutes’ chat with
her through the barred windows of her <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>sala</i></span>; but when a Spaniard
leads his wife from the altar, he knows no more of her character,
attainments, and disposition than does the parish priest who
married them, and perhaps not so much.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In one respect Spanish lovers have a great advantage over their
unfortunate colleagues in France. There marriage is impossible
without parental consent, whereas in Spain a law exists concerning
which the writer just quoted says:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Should a Spanish lad and lassie become attached to one
another, and the parents absolutely forbid the match, and refuse
their daughter liberty and permission to marry, the lover has his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>remedy at law. He has but to make a statement of the facts
on paper, and deposit it, signed and attested, with the alcalde or
mayor of the township in which the lady’s parents dwell. The
alcalde then makes an order, giving the young man the right of
free entry into the house in question, within a certain number of
days, for the purpose of wooing and carrying off his idol. The
parents dare not interfere with the office of the alcalde, and the
lady is taken to her lover’s arms. From that moment he, and he
alone, is bound to provide for her: by his own act and deed she
has become his property.” Should he prove false “the law comes
upon him with all its force, and he is bound to maintain her, in
every way, as a wife, under pain of punishment.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus a Spanish girl is protected against perfidious lovers as
well as is an English and American girl through the possibility of
suing for breach of promise. If the short stories told in <cite>Don
Quixote</cite> may be taken as examples, faithless lovers were very
common in Spain at that time; which, doubtless, accounts for the
origin of this law. The girls on their part erred by yielding too
easily to the promises of the men; though they are partially
excused by the great strength of their passions.</p>

<p class='c001'>In his work on Suicide, Professor Morselli has statistics showing
that more women take their life in Spain than in any other
country; and he attributes this to the force of their passions,
which is greater than in Italy, where the number of female suicides
is considerably lower.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus Love has a more favourable ground in Spain than either
in Italy or in France, notwithstanding certain restrictions. And
the result shows itself in this, that all tourists unite in singing the
praises of Spanish Beauty. Spain, indeed, unites in itself all the
conditions favourable to Beauty: a climate tempting to outdoor
life; a considerable amount of intellectual culture and æsthetic
refinement; a mixture of nationalities, fusing <em>ethnic</em> peculiarities
into a harmonious whole; and Love, which fuses <em>individual</em> complementary
qualities into a harmonious ensemble of beautiful
features, graceful figure, amiable disposition, and refined manners.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>GERMAN LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>When Tacitus penned his famous certificate of good moral
character for the Germans of his time, he little suspected how
many thousand times it would be quoted by the grateful and
proud descendants of those early Teutons, and pinned to the lapels
of their coats as a sort of prize medal in the competition for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>ancestral virtue. The more candid historians, however, admit
that the Roman historian somewhat overdrew his picture in order
to teach his own profligate countrymen a sort of Sunday school
lesson, by the vivid contrast presented by these inhabitants of the
northern virgin forests.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no question that women were held in considerable
honour among these early Germans. Many of them served as
priestesses, and adultery was punished with death. Polygamy
existed only among the chiefs, and even among them it was not
common. Yet the men did not treat the women as their equals.
“They had more duties than privileges,” says Schweiger-Lerchenfeld.
Their husbands were addicted to excessive drinking or
gambling when not engaged in war or the chase, leaving the hard
domestic and field labour to the women: and all this cannot have
tended to refine the women.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Marriage in the old Germanic times,” says Ploss, “was mostly
an affair of expediency.... In the choice of a wife beauty was of
less moment than property and good social antecedents. Love
<em>before</em> the betrothal rarely occurs.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Gustav Freytag, in his <cite>Pictures of German Life</cite>, during the
fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries, remarks: “Marriage
was considered by our ancestors less as a union of two lovers than
as an institution replete with duties and rights, not only of married
people towards one another, but also towards their relatives, as a
bond uniting two corporate bodies.... Therefore in the olden
time the choice of husband and wife was always an affair of importance
to the relatives on both sides, so that a German wooing
from the oldest times, <em>even until the last century</em>, had the appearance
of a business transaction, which was carried out with great
regard to suitability.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And a business transaction it is, unfortunately, to the present
day, in the vast majority of cases. A certain amount of dower or
property on the bride’s part is the first and most essential requisite.
Second in importance is the desirability of not descending even a
step in the social ladder, though an extra lump of gold commonly
suffices to pull down social Pride to a lower level. Health, temper,
Personal Beauty, and mutual suitability—these are the trifles
which, other things being equal, come in as a third consideration.
And thus is the order of Sexual Selection, as ordained by Love,
commonly reversed.</p>

<p class='c001'>What would an English or American youth of twenty-two say
to his father if the latter should undertake to write to all his
relatives, asking them to look about for an eligible partner for his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>son, and capping the climax by starting himself on a trip in search
of a bride for his son? Would he accept without a murmur the
girl thus found, and would an English or American girl thus allow
herself to be given away like a cat in a bag, not knowing <a id='corr272.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='whether'>whither</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_272.4'><ins class='correction' title='whether'>whither</ins></a></span>
she was going? I have seen several such cases with my own eyes.
One of them was most pathetic. For when the blooming bride, a
sweet and refined girl, was introduced to the bridegroom selected
for her by her parents—a repulsive-looking brute, twice her age—she
conceived a perfect loathing for him, and almost wept out her
eyes before the wedding-day. But the man was rich, and that
settled the matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>What aggravated this outrage was the fact that the bride’s
father also was rich. And herein, in fact, lies the canker of the
German system. Money is such a comfortable thing to have that
it is useless to preach against it. There are money-marriages
enough in England and America. But in these countries it is
generally considered sufficient if one party has the money. Not
so in Germany. It is not so much the comfort ensured by a
certain amount of money that is aimed at as the superior social
influence ensured by a large amount of wealth. Hence the rich
marry the rich, regardless of other consequences, and poor
Cupid is left shivering in the cold. So that, after all, the silly
pride of social position is a greater enemy of Romantic Love than
money.</p>

<p class='c001'>And the consequences of such a matrimonial system? They
have been most eloquently set forth by the blind old philosopher,
Dr. Dühring:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“The amalgamation of fortunes, and the resulting enervating
luxury of living, are the ruling matrimonial motives; and the want
of mutual adaptation of the individuals becomes the cause of the
degenerate appearance of the offspring. The loathsome products
of such marriages then walk about as ugly embodiments and
witnesses of such a degraded system of legalised prostitution
(<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Kuppelwirthschaft</cite></span>). They bear the stamp of incongruity on body
and mind; for their appearance shows them to be the offspring of
disharmonious parents, blindly associated, or even, in many cases,
of parents who themselves are already products of this new matrimonial
method. This degeneracy necessarily continues from one
generation to another, and in this manner maltreated Nature
avenges herself by leading to personal decrepitude and the formation
of a new sort of idiocy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is true,” he adds, “that love is not an infallible sign of
mutual suitability; but when it is absent, or even replaced by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>aversion, it is certain that it is useless to expect a specially
harmonious composition of the offspring.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Is this one of the reasons why Personal Beauty is so rare,
comparatively, in Germany?</p>

<p class='c001'>But Individual Preference is not the only element of Love
which thus suffers in Germany through false Pride and parental
tyranny. Gallantry is another factor which needs mending.
German women are sweet and amiable. In fact, they are <em>too</em>
sweet and good-natured. They have spoiled the men, who in consequence
are excessively selfish in their relations to women—the
most selfish men in the world, outside of Turkey or China. True,
the German officer in a ballroom seems to be the very essence of
officious Gallantry. But his motives are too transparently
Ovidian: it is not true Anglo-American politeness of the heart
that inspires his conduct. He is either after forbidden sweets or
parading his uniform and his vanity. Take the same man and
watch him at home. His wife has to get him his chair, move it
up to the fire, bring him his slippers, put the coffee in his hand,
and do errands for him. When he goes out she puts on his overcoat
and buttons it up carefully for him as if he were a helpless
big baby. This would be all very well—for why should not
women be gallant too?—if he would only retaliate. But he never
dreams of it. Even if it comes to a task which calls for masculine
muscular power—the carrying of bundles, etc.—he makes the
wife do it. He is, in fact, matrimonially considered, not only a
big baby but also a big brute, the very incarnation of masculine
selfishness.</p>

<p class='c001'>In former centuries it was customary in Germany, as it is now
with us, for women to bow first to men. The modern German
has reversed this. Woman has no right to bow until her lord
and superior has invited her to do so by doffing his hat.</p>

<p class='c001'>The German girl, says the Countess von Bothmer in <cite>German
Home Life</cite>, “is taught that to be womanly she must be helpless,
to be feminine she must be feeble, to endear herself she must be
dependent, to charm she must cling.” “To keep carefully to the
sheep-walk, to applaud in concert and condemn in chorus, is the
only behaviour that can be tolerated.” “They have one bugbear
and one object of idolatry, these monotonous ladies,—a fetish
which they worship under the name of Mode; a monster between
public opinion and Mrs. Grundy. To say a thing is not ‘Mode’
here, is to condemn it as if by all the laws of Media and Persia.
It is not her centre [<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sic</i></span>], but the system of her social education,
that renders the German woman so hopelessly provincial.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>Of course it is the men who are responsible for this social education
and this feminine ideal of absolute dependence. It suits
their selfish pleasure to be worshipped and obeyed by the women
without any efforts at gallant retaliation on their part.</p>

<p class='c001'>A native writer tells us that “a true German philosophises
occasionally while he embraces his sweetheart; while kissing even,
theories will sprout in his mind.”</p>

<p class='c001'>No wonder, therefore, that one of the German metaphysicians,
Fichte, should have made a sophistic attempt to reduce masculine
selfishness to a system. He proves to his own satisfaction that it
is woman’s duty to sacrifice herself in man’s behalf; while man,
on his part, has no such obligations. His reasoning is too elaborate
to quote in full; but is too amusingly naïve to be omitted, so I
will translate the summary of it given by Kuno Fischer in his
<cite>History of Philosophy</cite>:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“What woman’s natural instincts demand is self-abandonment
to a man; she desires this abandonment not for her own sake,
but for the man’s sake; she gives herself to him, for him. Now
abandoning oneself for another is self-sacrifice, and self-sacrifice
from an instinctive impulse is <span class='sc'>Love</span>. Therefore love is a kind of
instinctive impulse which the sexual instinct in woman necessarily
and involuntarily assumes. She feels the necessity of loving....
This impulse is peculiar to woman alone; woman alone loves [!!!];
only through woman does love appear among mankind.... The
woman’s life should disappear in the man’s without a remnant, and
it is this relation that is so beautifully and correctly indicated in
the fact that the wife no longer uses her own name, but that
of her husband [!].”</p>

<p class='c001'>The latest (and it is to be hoped the last) of the German metaphysicians,
the pessimist Hartmann, goes even a step beyond
Fichte in arrogating for man special privileges in Love. If Fichte
makes Love synonymous with Self-Sacrifice—feminine, mind you,
not masculine—Hartmann tries to prove that man may love as
often as he pleases, but woman only once. And what aggravates
the offence, he does it in such a poetic manner. “Though it may
be doubtful,” he says, “whether a man can truly love two women
at the same time, it is beyond all doubt that he can love several in
succession with all the depth of his heart; and the assertion that
there is only one true love is an unwarranted generalisation to all
mankind of a maxim which is true of woman alone.... Woman
can learn but once by experience what love is, and it is painful for
the lover not to be the one who teaches her first. True it is that
a tree nipped by a spring frost brings forth a second crown of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>leaves, but so rich and luxuriant as the first it will not be; thus
does a maiden-heart produce a second bloom, if the first had
to wither before maturity, but its full and complete floral glory is
unfolded only where love, aroused for the first time, passes in full
vigour through all its phases.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet it is not ungallant selfishness alone that prompts German
men to bring up their women so that they shall be mere playthings
at first and drudges after marriage, never real soul-mates. They
have the same old stupid continental fear that culture of the
intellect weakens the feelings. This fear is based on slovenly
reasoning—on the inference that because a few blue-stockings have
at all ages made themselves ridiculous by assuming masculine
attributes and parading their lack of tenderness and feminine
delicacy, therefore intellectual training must be fatal to feminine
charms. As if there were not plenty of masculine blue-stockings,
or pedants, without disproving the fact that the men of the greatest
intellectual power—men of genius—are also the most emotional
and refined of all men; or the fact proved by this whole monograph,
that Love and general emotional refinement grow with the
general intellectual culture of women.</p>

<p class='c001'>A typical illustration of German feeling on the subject of female
education is to be found in Schweiger-Lerchenfeld’s <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Frauenleben
der Erde</cite></span>, p. 530. Referring to the attempts now being made in
France to give young girls a rational education, he quotes the
opinion of a French legislator that a girl thus brought up would
not love less deeply than heretofore, while she would love more
intelligently; and then comments as follows: “How far this
anticipation may be realised cannot be decided now or in the near
future. At any rate we must leave to the French themselves the
task of getting along with this classical female generation of the
future. Certain it is that their experiment will hardly be imitated,
and that the old Romans and Greeks may eventually become more
dangerous to masculine supremacy (Autorität) than the pilgrimage
stories of Lourdes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is time for German woman to rise in revolt against this
mediæval masculine selfishness. Not in active revolt, for a warlike
woman is an abomination. But in passive revolt. Let them
cease to spoil the men, and these bears will become more gallant.
Germany is later in almost every phase of literary and social
culture than England. It was not an accident that Shakspere
came before Heine, the English before the German poet of Love;
for Love is much less advanced in Germany than in England. It
has not even passed the stage where a harsh sort of Coyness is still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>in place. German women want to learn the cunning to be strange,
They are too deferential to the men, too easily won. They want
to learn to indulge in harmless flirtation, and they want the education
which will give them wit enough to flirt cleverly and make
the men mellow.</p>

<p class='c001'>It must be admitted, however, notwithstanding all these
strictures, that there is much genuine Romantic Love in Germany,
often differing in no wise from Anglo-American Love. At first
sight it seems, indeed, as if chaperonage were as strict as in
France; and no doubt many German girls are brought up on the
spring-chicken-coyness system which regards every man as a hawk,
and a signal for hiding away in a corner. But in general German
girls have much more freedom than French girls. They
may walk alone in the street in the daytime, go alone to
the conservatory to attend a music-lesson. They meet the young
men freely at evening parties, dances, musical entertainments,
etc.; and the chaperons are not nearly so obtrusive and offensive
as in France. The mothers appear to have taken to heart
Jean Paul’s saying that “in the mother’s presence it is impossible
to carry on an edifying conversation with the daughter.”
So that there is plenty of opportunity for falling in love; and
were it not for parental dictation, Love-matches would perhaps
be as common as in England. But the girls lack independence
of spirit to defy parental tyranny, which it is their <em>moral duty</em>
to defy where money or rank are pitted against Love. For the
health and happiness of the next generation are at stake.</p>

<p class='c001'>German girls also enjoy an advantage over the French in
having a literature which is pure and wholesome; and by reading
about Romantic Love they train and deepen their feelings. It is
often said that Heine’s influence has been chiefly negative. The
truth is, <em>Heine is the greatest emotional educator Germany has
ever had</em>. More young men and girls have wept over his pathetic
lyrics than over any other poetry. His <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Buch der Lieder</cite></span> has done
more to foster the growth of Romantic Love in Germany than all
other collections of verse combined; not only by their own
unadorned beauty, but through the soulful music wedded to these
poems by Schubert, Schumann, and other magicians of the heart.
The fact that the copyright on Heine’s works was soon to expire,
and the country to be flooded with cheap editions, has long caused
Master Cupid to rub his hands in gleeful anticipation of brisk business;
and he has just given orders in his arsenal for one
hundred thousand new golden arrows.</p>

<p class='c001'>Heine indeed fathomed the secrets of Love much more deeply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>than Goethe. Whereas Heine sang of Love in every major and
minor key, Goethe appears to have emphasised chiefly its transitoriness.
“Love, as Goethe knows it,” says Professor Seeley, “is
very tender, and has a lyric note as fresh as that of a song-bird.
In his <cite>Autobiography</cite> one love-passage succeeds another, but each
comes speedily to an end. How far in each case he was to blame
is a matter of controversy. But he seems to betray a way of
thinking about women such as might be natural to an Oriental
sultan. ‘I was in that agreeable phase,’ he writes, ‘when a new
passion had begun to spring up in me before the old one had quite
disappeared.’ About Frederika he blames himself without reserve,
and uses strong expressions of contrition; but he forgets the
matter strangely soon. In his distress of mind he says he found
riding, and especially skating, bring much relief. This reminds us
of the famous letter to the Frau von Stein about coffee. He is
always ready in a moment to shake off the deepest impressions and
receive new ones; and he never looks back.... Goethe was a
man of the old <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>régime</i></span>.... Had he entered into the reforming
movement of his age, he might have striven to elevate women....
He certainly felt at times that all was not right in the status of
women (‘woman’s fate is pitiable’), and how narrowly confined was
their happiness (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">wie enggebunden ist des Weibes Glück</span>) ... but
he was not a reformer of institutions.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A reformer of institutions, however, has apparently just arisen
in Berlin. For we read that at a private female seminary the girls
received the following subject for an essay: “There is from the
Ideas of Plato, the atoms of Democritus, the Substance of Spinoza,
the monads of Leibnitz, and from the subjective mental forms of
Kant, the proof to bring, that the philosophy it never neglected
has the to-be-calculated results of their hypotheses with their into-perception-falling
effects to compare.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Such subjects, so elegantly expressed, are no doubt eminently
calculated to bring out the latent possibilities of feminine feeling
and culture.</p>

<p class='c001'>To close this chapter with a sweet, soothing concord—major
triad, horns and ’cellos, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>smorzando</i></span>—it must be admitted that the
Germans have one ingredient of Romantic Love which all other
nations must envy them. They have one more thrill in the drama
of Love, in the ascending scale of familiarities, than we have, namely,
the word <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Du</i></span>, which is something very different from the stilted
<em>Thou</em>, because still a part of everyday language. The second
person singular is used in Germany towards pet animals and
children, between students, intimate friends, relatives, and lovers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>French “lovers” do not say <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>tu</i></span> to each other till after marriage, and
even then they do not use it in public. But the German lover has
the privilege, as soon as he is engaged, of exchanging the formal <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Sie</i></span>
for the affectionate <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Du</i></span>; and the first <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Du</i></span> that comes from her lips
can hardly be less sweet than the first kiss.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a game of cards, popular among young folks in Germany,
during which you have to address every one with <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Du</i></span> whom you
otherwise would have to call <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Sie</i></span>, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versâ</i></span>; cards have to be
called spoons, white black, etc. If there is a young man in the
company secretly in love with a young lady, you can always
“spot” him by the eagerness he shows to speak to her, and the
fact that he always gets the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Du</i></span> right and everything else wrong;
while she, strange to say, appears to have never heard of such a
thing at all as a personal pronoun.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>ENGLISH LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Concerning Romantic Love in England and America, there is
less to be said under the head of National Peculiarities than in
case of the continental nations of Europe, for the simple reason
that almost everything said in the pages on Modern Love refers
especially to these two countries. Anglo-American Love is
Romantic Love, pure and simple, as first depicted by Shakspere,
and after him, with more or less accuracy, by a hundred other
poets and novelists. There is no lack of colour in this Love—colour
warm and glowing—but it is no longer a mere local colour, a
national or provincial peculiarity, but Love in its essence, its
cosmopolitan aspect; Love such as will in course of time prevail
throughout the world, when the Anglisation of this planet—which
is only a question of time—shall have been completed.</p>

<p class='c001'>England has many a bright jewel in the crown of her achievements
in behalf of civilisation, but the <a id='corr288.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='brighest'>brightest</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_288.30'><ins class='correction' title='brighest'>brightest</ins></a></span> of all is this, that
she was the first country in the world—ancient, mediæval, or
modern—that removed the bars from woman’s prison-windows,
opened every door to Cupid, and made him thoroughly welcome
and comfortable. And grateful Cupid has retaliated by setting up
English manners and customs as a model which all other nations
are slowly but surely copying. Eighteen million souls in the
United States, or almost two persons in every five, are not of
English origin; yet of these there are not one million who have
not given up their old country methods of courtship as antiquated,
and adopted the Anglo-American style. The Germans in America
make love not after the German but after the English fashion. So
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>do the French, though somewhat more reluctantly and tardily. In
San Francisco and Chicago it is said that but one name in ten
is of English origin; yet who ever heard of a San Franciscan
or Chicagoan making love in foreign style? During the
last hundred years the majority of the immigrants to America
have come from non-English countries; yet, though the parents
enter the country as adults with all their national traditions
stamped on their memories, they invariably allow their sons and
daughters to court and be courted in American style. And now
that England is gradually extending her influence to every one of
the five continents, Romantic Love—to whose sway, quite as much
as to their outdoor active life, the English owe the fact that they are
to-day the handsomest and most energetic race in the world—is
also rapidly extending its sphere, and will finally oust the last
vestiges of Oriental despotism, feminine suppression, and mediæval
masculine barbarism.</p>

<p class='c001'>For some centuries woman has been more favoured by law, and
especially by national custom, in England than in any other
European state. It is true that the Englishman who beats his
wife is the most brutal savage on the face of the globe, but he is
to be found only among the lowest classes. Nor has wife-selling
ever been quite such a universal custom in England as foreigners
imagine; although cases are on record as far back as 1302 and as
late as 1884. In an article in <cite>All the Year Round</cite> (Dec. 20, 1884)
more than twenty cases are enumerated with full details, the price
of a wife varying from twenty-five guineas to a pint or half a pint
of beer, or a penny and a dinner; and the <cite>Times</cite> of July 22, 1797,
remarks sarcastically: “By some mistake or omission, in the report
of the Smithfield market, we have not learned the average price of
wives for the week. The increasing value of the fair sex is esteemed
by several eminent writers the certain criterion of increasing
civilisation. Smithfield has, on this ground, strong pretensions to
refined improvement, as the price of wives has risen in that market
from half a guinea to three guineas and a half.”</p>

<p class='c001'>That these cases occurred only among the lowest classes is self-evident;
yet even the lowest classes often resented the brutal
transaction by pelting the offenders with stones and mud; whereas,
as far as the women were concerned, the offence was mitigated by
the fact that in all cases on record they appear to have been only
too glad to be sold, so as to get rid of their tyrants.</p>

<p class='c001'>It cannot be said that English women are all exempt from the
hardest manual labour even to-day; but the tendency to relieve
them of tasks unsuited to feminine muscular development has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>existed longer in England than elsewhere. The difference can be
best observed with regard to agricultural labour. Any one who
travels through Italy, Switzerland, France, or Germany in the
autumn, gets the impression that most of the harvesting is done by
the women; whereas in England, as shown by statistics, there are
twenty-two men to every woman engaged as field-labourers. Yet
even at that rate there are still 64,840 women in England engaged
in agricultural labour unsuited to their sex.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, English women, like American women, are
manifesting a great disposition at present to try their hand or
brain at almost every employment heretofore considered exclusively
masculine. The census enumerates 349 different classes of work,
and of these all but about 70 have been invaded by women; including
5 horse-dealers, 14 bicycle makers and dealers, 16 sculptors,
18 fence makers, 19 fossil diggers, etc.; whereas there are as yet no
female pilots, dentists, police officers, shepherds, law students,
architects, cab-drivers, commercial travellers, barristers, etc. [Full
list in <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>, Oct. 3, 1884.]</p>

<p class='c001'>Inasmuch as there are almost a million more women than men
in England, it is not surprising that women should thus seek to
extend their sphere of usefulness. We live in an experimental
epoch, when it is to be ascertained what is and what is not becoming
to woman regarded as a labourer. It is therefore of the utmost
importance that there should be some standard by which each employment
is to be judged. And this standard, fortunately, is
supplied by Romantic Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have seen that the tendency of civilisation has been to
differentiate the sexes more and more in appearance, character, and
emotional susceptibilities, and that on this differentiation depends
the existence and power of Love, because it <em>individualises</em> man and
woman, and Love is the more intense the more it is individualised.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hence every employment which tends to make woman masculine
in appearance or habits is to be tabooed by her because antagonistic
to Love. If she, nevertheless, persists in it, Love will have its
revenge by eliminating her through Sexual Selection. No man
will marry a masculine woman, or fall in love with her, so that
her unnatural temperament will not be transmitted to the next
generation and multiplied.</p>

<p class='c001'>But what is to be accepted as the standard of femininity? The
answer is given us by Nature. Throughout the animal world, with
a few insignificant exceptions, the sexes are differentiated distinctly;
and the female is the more tender and gentle of the two,
the more devoted to domestic affection and the care and education
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>of the young, the more amiable, and, above all, less aggressive, bold,
and pugnacious than the male. “Any education which women
undergo,” says the <cite>Spectator</cite>, “should be an education not for the
militant life of war against evil but for the spiritual life inspiring
a persuasive or patient charity.... Even in a field properly
suited to them—the field of charitable institutions, of poor-law
work, of educational representation—women no sooner take up the
cudgels than they lose their appropriate influence, and are either
unsexed or paralysed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>According to Mr. Ruskin, “woman’s work is—(1) To please
people. (2) To feed them in dainty ways. (3) To clothe them.
(4) To keep them orderly. (5) To teach them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Statistics concerning the employments instinctively sought by
the majority of women bear out Mr. Ruskin’s table quite well.
Woman’s first duty is to please people by being beautiful, amiable,
and fascinating in conversation and manners. No man would
marry a woman unless she pleased him in one way or another;
hence matrimony is the most successful female profession, which
in England includes 4,437,962 women. But there are other ways
in which women seek to please and prosper; hence there are in
England 2368 actresses as against 2197 actors, and 11,376 women
whose profession is music, as against 14,170 men.</p>

<p class='c001'>Domestic service, which includes the “feeding in dainty ways”
(though too often the “dainty” must be omitted), employs
1,230,406 women in England—about 30,000 fewer than industrial
employments, which are somewhat more popular owing to the
greater individual liberty they allow the employed. Yet domestic
service is a much better preparation for married life than labour in
a manufactory; so that, other things being equal, a labouring man
looking for a wife would be apt to select one who has learned how
to take care of his home. This thought ought to help to render
domestic service more popular.</p>

<p class='c001'>“To clothe them.” Dressmaking, staymaking (alas!), and
millinery, employ 357,995 women in England.</p>

<p class='c001'>“To keep them orderly.” Bathing and washing service employ
176,670 women; medicine and nursing, almost 50,000; missions,
1660.</p>

<p class='c001'>“To teach them.” This, one of woman’s special vocations,
eminently suited to her capacity, employs 123,995 females.</p>

<p class='c001'>If I have failed in correctly interpreting Mr. Ruskin’s oracle, I
stand subject to correction from that earnest labourer in the task
of finding for woman her proper sphere—a work for which he has
not yet received the recognition and thanks he deserves.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>That marriage, and not miscellaneous employment, is woman’s
true destiny, is shown by the way in which Cupid influences statistics.
Thus there are in England about 29,000 school-mistresses
aged 15-20, and 28,500 aged 25-45; but the time from 20-25,
the period of courtship and marriage, has only 21,000. In the
case of dressmakers this fact is brought out still more strikingly:
15-20—84,000; 20-25—76,000; 25-45—129,000, in round
numbers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although, therefore, as Emerson remarks, “the circumstances
may be easily imagined in which woman may speak, vote, argue
cases, legislate, and drive coaches, if only it comes by degrees,”
facts show that there is more philosophy of the future in Mrs.
Hawthorne’s remark that “Home, I think, is the great arena for
women, and there, I am sure, she can wield a power which no king
or emperor can cope with.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A consideration of all the foregoing facts shows that Love may
be safely accepted as a guiding-star in making a proper division of
the world’s labour between men and women. And the reason why
England and America have made so much more progress than
other nations in ascertaining woman’s true capacity and sphere,
is because she has been educated to a point where she can assert
her independence, and where she can inspire as well as feel Love—thus
making man humble, gallant, gentle, ready to make concessions
and remove restrictions. It is in England and America
alone that Love plays a more important <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span> in marriage than
money and social position; that the young are generally permitted
to consult their own heart instead of parental command; and that
the opportunities for courtship are so liberal and numerous that
the young are enabled to fall in love with one another not only for
dazzling qualities of Personal Beauty, viewed for a moment, but for
traits of character, emotional refinement, and a cultured intellect.</p>

<p class='c001'>These two nations alone have fully taken to heart and heeded
Addison’s maxim that “Those marriages generally abound most
with love and constancy that are <em>preceded by a long courtship</em>.
The passion should strike root and gather strength before marriage
be grafted on it. A long course of hopes and expectations fixes
the idea in our minds, and habituates us to a fondness of the person
beloved.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There is, however, a difference between English and American
Love which shows that we have learned Addison’s lesson even
better than his own countrymen. As Mr. Robert Laird Collier
remarks in <cite>English Home Life</cite>: “The American custom, among
the mass of the people, of leaving young men and young women
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>free to associate together and to keep company with each other
for an indefinite length of time, without declaring their intentions,
is almost unknown in any country of Europe. It is not long
after a young man begins to show the daughter attentions before
the father gives intimation that he wishes to know what it means,
and either the youth declares his intentions or is notified to ‘cut
sticks.’” “Courtships in England are short, and engagements are
long.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The London <cite>Standard</cite> doubtless exaggerates the difference
between English and American girls and their attitude toward
men in the course of an article, part of which may, nevertheless,
be cited: “American girls offer a bright example to their English
sisters of a happy, unclouded youth, and instances seem to be few
of their abusing the liberty which is accorded to them. Perhaps
their immunity from sentimental troubles arises from the fact that
from earliest childhood they have been comrades of the other sex,
and are therefore not disposed to turn a man into a demi-god because
they only see one at rare intervals under the eagle eye of a
mother or aunt. A great revolution in public opinion would be
required ere English girls could be emancipated to the extent
which prevails on the other side of the Atlantic, and even then
it is doubtful whether the system would work well. The
daughters of Albion, with but few exceptions, are single-hearted,
earnest, and prone to look upon everything seriously. They often
make the mistake of imagining that a man is in love because he
is decently civil.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet in <cite>German Home Life</cite>, written from an English point
of view, we read that “There is no such thing as country life, as
we understand it, in Germany; no cosy sociability, smiling snugness,
pleasant bounties and hospitalities; and, above all, for the
young folk, no freedom, flirtation, boatings, sketchings, high teas,
scamperings, and merriments generally.” And again: “The sort
of frank ‘flirtation,’ beginning openly in fun and ending in amusement,
which is common amongst healthy, high-spirited boys and
girls in England, and has no latent element of intrigue or vanity
in it, but is born of exuberant animal spirits, youthful frolics, and
healthy pastimes shared together, is forbidden to her” (the German
girl).</p>

<p class='c001'>The <cite>Standard</cite> itself apparently contradicts itself in another
article on “Flirtation,” concerning which it says: “It is usually
so innocent that it has become part of the education most of our
young women pass through in their training for society. The
British matron smiles contentedly when she sees that her daughter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>just entered on her teens, exhibits a partiality for long walks and
soft-toned confabulations with her cousin Fred or her brother’s
favourite schoolmate. Three or four such juvenile attachments
will do the girl no harm, if they are gently watched over by the
parental eye. They serve to evolve the sexually social instincts in
a gradual way. Through them the bashful maiden learns the
nature of man in the same fashion as she takes lessons on the
piano. In a word, she is ‘getting her hand in’ for the real game
of matrimony that is to be played in a few years. Her youthful
swains, of course, derive their own instructions from these innocent
amours.... Chivalrous feeling is developed which it takes
a deal of worldly wisdom to smother in after years.... When
we observe this sentimentality in a boy, we derive great amusement
from it, but it should raise the lad in our estimation. He
has something in him to which ideals appeal, and his early-developed
susceptibility will—to use a beautiful but forgotten
word—engentle his nature.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps the difference between English and American courtship
and flirtation is not so great as often painted, and is becoming
less every year, owing to the Americanisation of Europe.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>AMERICAN LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>It is in the United States of America that Plato’s ideal—so
completely ignored by his countrymen—that young men and
women should have ample opportunity to meet and get acquainted
with one another before marriage, is most perfectly realised; as
well as Addison’s supplementary advice that marriage should be
preceded by a long courtship.</p>

<p class='c001'>As boys and girls in America are commonly educated in the
same schools, they are initiated at an early age into the sweets
and sorrows of Calf-love Courtship, which has such a refining
influence on the boys, and renders the girls more easy and natural
in society when they get older; destroying among other puerilities
that spring-chicken Coyness which makes many of their
European sisters appear so silly. In the Western country-schools
each girl has her “beau”—a boy of fourteen to seventeen—who
brings her flowers, apples, or other presents, accompanies her
home, and performs various other gallant services; nor has any
harm ever been known to result from this juvenile Courtship—except
an occasional elopement, in case of a prematurely frivolous
couple, whom it was just as well to get rid of in that way as any
other.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>When they get a little older, the young folks go to picnics
without a chaperon, or they enjoy a drive or sleigh-ride, or go a-skating
together; and after a party, dance, church fair, or other
social gathering, where the elders commonly keep out of the way
considerately, each young man accompanies a young lady home.
Were you to insinuate to him the advisability of having a chaperon
for the young lady, he would inform you pointedly that the young
lady needed no protection inasmuch as he was a <em>gentleman</em> and not
a tramp. It is this high sense of gentlemanly honour that protects
women in America—a hundred times better than all the
barred windows of the Orient and the dragons of Europe. Thanks
to this feeling of modern chivalry, a young lady may travel all
alone from New York to Chicago, or even to San Francisco, and,
if her manners are modest and refined, she will not once be insulted
by word or look, not even in passing through the roughest
mining regions.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is the consciousness of this chivalrous code of honour among
the men that gives an American girl the frank and natural gaze
which is one of her greatest charms, and that allows her to talk
to a man just introduced as if they were old acquaintances. It is
a knowledge of this gentlemanly code that makes parents feel
perfectly at ease in leaving their daughter alone in the parlour all
the evening with a visitor. In a word, American customs prove
that if you treat a man as a gentleman he will behave like a
gentleman.</p>

<p class='c001'>Unquestionably there are girls who abuse the liberty allowed
them, and encourage the men to encourage them in their freedom.
Mr. Henry James has done a most valuable service in holding up
the mirror to one of these girls, to serve as a warning to all Daisy
Millers and semi-Daisy Millers. There are not a few of the latter
kind, and I have myself met three full-fledged specimens of the
real “Daisy” in Europe—girls who would not have hesitated to
go out rowing on a lake at eleven o’clock in the evening with a
man known to them only a few hours, or to go next day with him
to visit an old tower, or to say that mamma “always makes a fuss
if I introduce a gentleman. But I <em>do</em> introduce them—almost
always. If I didn’t introduce my gentlemen friends to mother, I
shouldn’t think I was natural.” It is this class of American
tourists that have, unfortunately, given foreigners a caricatured
notion of the American girl’s deportment.</p>

<p class='c001'>Etiquette differs somewhat in various American cities and
among the different classes. For instance, a young lady of the
“upper circles,” who in Chicago is permitted to drive to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>theatre in a carriage with a young man, is not allowed the same
privilege in New York.</p>

<p class='c001'>The New York <cite>Sun</cite>, an excellent authority in social matters,
gives the whole philosophy of American Courtship and Love in
answering a young man’s question as to whether, in asking a young
lady of the highest circles to accompany him to a place of amusement,
it is necessary to invite a chaperon at the same time. He
is told that he must,—in those circles:—</p>

<p class='c001'>"But these people are only a few among the many. What is
called society more exclusively in New York comprises, all told, no
more than a hundred or two hundred families. Outside of them,
of course, there are larger circles, to which they give the law to a
greater or less extent, but the whole number of men and women
in this great town of a million and a half of inhabitants who pay
obedience to that law is not over a few thousand.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Nine girls out of ten in New York, with the full consent of
their parents and as a matter of course, accompany young men to
amusements without taking a chaperon along. They feel, and
they are, entirely able to look out for themselves, and they would
regard the whole fun as spoiled if a third person was on hand to
watch over them. A large part of the audience at every theatre is
always made up of young men and young women who have come
out in pairs, and who have no thought of violating any rule of
propriety. Very many of these girls would never be invited to the
theatre by their male acquaintances if they were under the dominion
of such a usage, for the men want them to themselves, else they
would not ask their company, and besides do not feel able to pay
for an extra ticket for an obnoxious third person; or, if they have
a little more money to spare, they prefer to expend it at an ice-cream
saloon after the play.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Nor can it be said that the morals of these less formal young
people are any worse than those of the more exacting society.
Probably they are better on the average, and if the laws of Murray
Hill prevailed throughout this city, the marriage-rate of New York
would be likely to decline, for nothing discourages the passion of
the average young man so much as his inability to meet the
charmer except in the presence of a third person, who acts as a
buffer between him and her. He feels that he has no show, and
cannot appear to good advantage under the eyes of a cool critic,
whereas if he could walk with the girl alone in the shades of the
balmy evening, the courage to declare his affection would come
to him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore it is that engagements, even in the most fashionable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>society, are commonly made in the country during the summer,
where the young people come together more freely and more
constantly than in the town.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The attempt made in certain corners of New York “Society”
to introduce the foreign system of chaperonage is one of the most
absurd and incongruous efforts at aping foreign fashions (which are
on the decline even in Europe) ever witnessed in our midst. In
Europe Chaperonage is in so far excusable, as it is a modified
survival from barbarous times when men were mostly brutes, being
drunk half the time and on military expeditions the other half.
To treat American men, who are brought up as gentlemen, and
commonly behave as such, as mediæval ruffians, is a gratuitous
insult, which they ought to resent by avoiding those houses where
Oriental experiments are being tried with the daughters. That
would bring the “mammas” to reason very soon.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet it would seem as if New York “Society” had already had
enough of the Oriental experiment; for the same high authority
just quoted asserted last autumn that “A regular stampede in
favour of the liberty of the young unmarried female is to be undertaken
this winter by a number of ‘three-years-in-society’ veterans,
supported and encouraged by nearly all this seasons <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>débutantes</i></span>.
The first step is to be the establishment of a right on the part of
young girls to form parties for theatre <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>matinées</i></span> and afternoon
concerts, untrammelled by the presence of even a matron of their
own age, and to which all ‘reliable and well-behaved young men
are to be eligible.’... Rule No. 2 establishes beyond all dispute
the often-mooted question whether the presence of a brother and
sister in a party of young people going to any place of evening
amusement throws a shield of respectability over the others of the
party. Society long ago frowned upon this mongrel kind of
chaperonage; but upon the principle that no young man would
permit indiscretions or improprieties in a party of which his sister
made one, the ‘veterans’ have voted in favour of it. The young
man with a sister is therefore to enact the part of dragon on these
occasions, and will be largely in demand. Failing a convenient
sister, he may get a cousin, perhaps, to take her place.”</p>

<p class='c001'>When it comes to the cousin, the reversion to Americanism,
pure and simple, will be complete.</p>

<p class='c001'>The gentlemanliness and Gallantry of Americans have at all
times been acknowledged by observers of all nationalities; and it
is indeed hardly too much to say that the average American is
disposed to treat the whole female sex with a studied Gallantry,
which in most European countries is reserved by men for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>one girl with whom they happen to be in love. Even the irate
and vituperative Anthony Trollope in his book on North America
was obliged to admit that “It must be borne in mind that in that
country material wellbeing and education are more extended than
with us, and that therefore men there have learned to be chivalrous
who with us have hardly progressed so far. The conduct of the
men to the women throughout the states is always gracious....
But it seems to me that the women have not advanced as far as
the men have done.... In America the spirit of chivalry has
sunk deeper among men than it has among women.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Anthony Trollope is by no means the only writer who has put
his finger on the greatest foible of American women. No doubt
they have, as a class, been spoiled by excessive masculine Gallantry.
They do not, like the women of the Troubadour period, who were
similarly spoilt, go quite so far as to send their knights on crusades
and among lepers, but they often shroud themselves in an atmosphere
of selfishness which is very unfeminine—to choose a complimentary
adjective.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the East, where there is already a large excess of women
over men, this evil is less marked than in the West, where women
are still in a minority. Thus the Denver <cite>Tribune</cite>, in an article on
“The Impoliteness of Women,” remarks: “If there is any characteristic
of Americans of which they are more proud than any other,
it is the courtesy which the men who are natives of this country
exhibit towards women, and the respect which the gentler sex
receives in public. This is a trait of the American character of
which Americans are justly proud, and in which they doubtless
excel the people of any other country. But while this is true of
the men, it is a matter to be deeply regretted that as much cannot
be said of the women of this country.” After praising American
women for their beauty, vivacity, high moral character, and other
charms, the <cite>Tribune</cite> adds that they “seem very generally to be
prompted in their conduct in public by a spirit of selfishness which
very often finds expression in acts of positive rudeness.” They
are ungrateful, it continues, to the men who give up their seats in
street-cars; they compel men to step into a muddy street, instead
of walking one behind the other at a crossing; and at such places
as the stamp-window of the post-office they do not wait for their
turn, but force the men to stand aside.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another Western paper, the Chicago <cite>Tribune</cite>, complains that
in that city there are 10,000 homes in which the daughters are
ignorant of the simplest kind of household duties. It adds “That
they do not desire to learn; that, having been brought up to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>nothing except appear gracefully in society, their object in life is
to marry husbands who can support them in idle luxury; that this
state of things has substituted for marriages founded on love and
respect a market in which the men have quoted money-values, and
where a young man, however great his talents, has no chance of
winning a wife from the charmed circle.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So that the pendulum has apparently swung to the other
extreme. In mediæval times the women were married for their
money by the lazy, selfish men; now the women are lazy and
selfish, while the men toil and are married for their money.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet there is much exaggeration in this view, which applies to
only a small portion of the American people. We are far from the
times when Miss Martineau complained of the feeble health of
American women, and attributed it to the vacuity of their minds.
Their health is still, on the average, inferior to that of English and
German damsels, from whom they could also learn useful lessons in
domestic matters; but intellectually the American woman has no
equal in the world; while her sweetness, grace, and proverbial
beauty combine into an ensemble which makes Cupid chuckle
whenever he looks at a susceptible young man.</p>

<p class='c001'>Goldsmith says somewhere that “the English love with violence,
and expect violent love in return.” Certainly this holds
true no less of the Americans. There are indeed several favourable
circumstances which combine to make Romantic Love more
ardent and more prevalent in the United States than in any other
part of the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) The first is the intellectual culture of women just referred
to, which they owe partly to the leisure they enjoy, partly to the
fact that America has the best elementary schools in the world, so
that their minds are aroused early from their dormant state. As
Bishop Spalding remarks: “Woman here in the United States is
more religious, more moral, and more intelligent than man; more
intelligent in the sense of greater openness to ideas, greater flexibility
of mind, and a wider acquaintance with literature.” Now
the whole argument of this book tends to show that the capacity
for feeling Romantic Love is dependent on intellectual culture, and
increases with it; hence we might infer that there is more Love
among the women of America than among those of any other country,
even if this were not so patent from the greater number of Love-matches
and various subtle signs known to international observers.</p>

<p class='c001'>And as the sweetest pleasure and goad of Love lies in the conviction
that it is really returned, man’s Love is thus doubled in
ardour through woman’s responsive sympathy.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>(2) That Courtship proper is longer than in England, and
engagement shorter, is a circumstance in favour of America. For
nothing adds so much to the ardour of Love as the uncertainty
which prevails during Courtship; whereas, after engagement, all
these alternate hopes and doubts, confidences and jealousies, are
quieted, and the ship approaches the still waters of the harbour of
matrimony, which may be quite as deep but are less sublime and
romantic than mid-ocean, with its possibilities of storm and shipwreck.</p>

<p class='c001'>Moreover, the longer the time of tentative Courtship, the fewer
are the chances of a mistake being made in selecting a sympathetic
spouse.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Germany an engagement is so conclusive an affair that it is
announced in the papers, and cards are sent out as at a wedding.
In America we meet with the other extreme, for it is not very
unusual for a couple to be engaged some time before even the
parents know it. Though there is such a thing as breach of
promise suits against fickle young men, such engagements, if
unsatisfactory to either side, are commonly broken off amicably.
And, as one of Mr. Howells’s characters remarks in <cite>Indian Summer</cite>:
“A broken engagement <em>may</em> be a bad thing in some cases, but I
am inclined to think it is the very best thing that could happen
in most cases where it happens. The evil is done long before; the
broken engagement is merely sanative, and so far beneficent.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Were engagements less readily dissolved, divorces would be
more frequent even than they are now.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) Parental dictation is almost unknown in America; nowhere
else have young men and women such absolute freedom to choose
their own soul-mate. Hence Individual Preference, on which the
ardour of Love depends in the highest degree, has full sway. The
comparative absence of barriers of rank and social grade also makes
it easier for a man to find and claim his real <em>Juliet</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>(4) This dependence of Love on Individualisation gives it
another advantage in America. For nowhere is there so great a
mixture of nationalities as here; and, <em>away from home</em>, a national
peculiarity of feature or manners has a sort of individualising effect.
Till we get used to such national peculiarities through their constant
recurrence we are apt to judge almost every woman in a new
city attractive. From this point of view Love may be defined as
an instinctive longing to absorb national traits, and blend them all
in the one cosmopolitan type of perfect Personal Beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'>(5) There are beautiful women in all countries of the world,
but no country has so many pretty girls as America. Money and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>rank find it hard to compete with such loveliness, hence Love has
its own way. Here alone is it possible to find heiresses who have
failed to get married through lack of Beauty. Personal Beauty is
the great matchmaker in America; and thus it comes that Beauty
is ever inherited and multiplied. For Love is the cause of Beauty
as Beauty is the cause of Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>One more characteristic of American Love remains to be noted—the
most unique of all. American women are of all women in the
world the most self-conscious, and have the keenest sense of humour.
To these quick-witted damsels the sentimental sublimities of amorous
Hyperbole, which may touch the heart of a naïve German or
Italian girl, are apt to appear dangerously near the ludicrous;
hence an American lover, if he is clever enough, deliberately covers
the step which separates the sublime from the ridiculous. He
gilds the gold of his compliments by using the form of playful
exaggeration, which is the more easy to him because exaggeration
is a national form of American humour. Mr. Howells’s heroes
often make love in this fashion. The lover in <cite>The Lady of the
Aroostook</cite> spices his flatteries with open burlesque, and succeeds
admirably with this new <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ars Amoris</cite></span>; and Colville in <cite>Indian
Summer</cite> says to Imogene: “Come, I’ll go, of course, Imogene. A
fancy-ball to please you is a very different thing from a fancy-ball
in the abstract.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, what nice things you say! Do you know, I always
admired your compliments? I think they’re the most charming
compliments in the world.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t think they’re half so pretty as yours; but they’re
more sincere.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, honestly. They flatter, and at the same time they make
fun of the flattery a little; they make a person feel that you like
them even while you laugh at them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Perfect success in this form of flattery requires a talent for
epigram. Not many, unfortunately, even in America, are poets
and wits at the same time, like Mr. Howells; but there is an
abundance of clever compliments nevertheless, and they are apt to
assume the form of playful exaggeration.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>SCHOPENHAUER’S THEORY OF LOVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>A first hasty perusal of Schopenhauer’s brilliant essay on the
“Metaphysics of Sexual Love” (in the second volume of his
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Welt als Wille und Vorstellung</cite></span>) will dispose most readers to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>agree with Dühring that the great pessimist “makes war on love.”
But a more careful consideration of his profound thoughts shows
that this is not the case, notwithstanding his habitual cynical
tone.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first place, his theory can do no possible harm, because,
as he himself admits, no lover will ever believe in it. Secondly,
the gist of Schopenhauer’s theory is to show that a lover is the
most noble and unselfish martyr in the world, because his usual
attitude and fate is self-sacrifice.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>LOVE IS AN ILLUSION</h3>

<p class='c013'>The fundamental truth which Schopenhauer claims to have
discovered is that love is an illusion—an <em>instinctive</em> belief on the
lover’s part that his life’s happiness absolutely depends on his
union with his beloved; whereas, in truth, a love-match commonly
leads to lifelong conjugal misery. The lover, on reaching the goal
so eagerly striven for, finds himself disappointed, and realises, to
his consternation, that he has been the dupe of a blind instinct.
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Quien se casa por amores, ha de vivir con dolores</span>, says a Spanish
proverb (“to marry for love is to live in misery”): and this
doctrine Schopenhauer re-echoes in a dozen different forms: “It
is not only disappointed love-passion that occasionally has a tragic
end; successful love likewise leads more commonly to misery than
to happiness.” “Marriages based on love commonly end unhappily,”
etc.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>INDIVIDUALS SACRIFICED TO THE SPECIES</h3>

<p class='c013'>The reason of this curious fact is given in this sentence:
“Love-marriages are formed in the interest of the species, not of
the individuals. True, the parties concerned imagine that they
are providing for their own happiness; but their real [unconscious]
aim is something foreign to their own selves—namely, the procreation
of an individual whose existence becomes possible only
through their marriage.”</p>

<p class='c001'>What urges a man on to this sacrifice of individual happiness
to the welfare of his offspring is, as already intimated, a blind
instinct known as Love. The universal <em>Will</em> (Schopenhauer’s
fetish, or name for an impersonal deity underlying all phenomena)
has implanted this blind instinct in man, for the same reason that
it implants so many other instincts in various animals—to induce
the parents to undergo any amount of labour, and even danger to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>life, for the sake of benefiting the offspring, and thus preserving
the species. All these animals, like the lovers, are urged on
blindly to sacrifice themselves in the belief that they are doing it
for their own pleasure and benefit; whereas it is all in the
interest of their offspring.</p>

<p class='c001'>Why was the <em>Will</em> compelled to implant this blind instinct in
man? Because man is so selfish wherever guided by reason, that
it would have been unwise to entrust so important a matter as
the welfare of coming generations to his intellect and prudence.
Prudence would tell young people to choose not the most attractive
and healthy partners, who would be able to transmit their
excellence to the next generation, but the ones who are most
liberally supplied with money and useful friends. That is, they
would invariably look out first for “Number One,” indifferent to
the deluge that might come after them. It was to neutralise this
selfishness that the <em>Will</em> created the instinct of Love, which
impels a man to marry not the woman who will make <em>him</em> the
most happy and comfortable, but whose qualities, combined with
his own, will be likely to produce a harmonious, well-made group
of children.</p>

<p class='c001'>Schopenhauer’s <em>Will</em>, it must be understood, is an æsthetic
sort of a chap. He has his hobbies, and one of these hobbies is
the desire to preserve the species in its typical purity and beauty.
There are a thousand accidents of climate, vice, disease, etc., that
tend to vitiate the type of each species; but Love strives for ever
to restore a harmonious balance, by producing a mutual infatuation
in two beings whose combined (and opposite) defects will
neutralise one another in the offspring.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>SOURCES OF LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>More definitely speaking, there are three ways in which the
<em>Will</em> preserves the purity of its types—three ways in which it
inspires the Love whose duty it is to achieve this result. Physical
Beauty is the first thing desired by the lover, because that is the
expression of typical perfection. Secondly, he may be influenced
by such Psychic Traits as will blend well with his own; and
thirdly, he will be attracted by perfections (or imperfections)
which are the opposite of his own. These three sources must be
considered briefly in detail.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <em>Physical Beauty.</em>—The most important attribute of
Beauty, in the lover’s eye, is Youth. Men prefer the age from
eighteen to twenty-eight in a woman; while women give the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>preference to a man aged from thirty to thirty-five, which
represents the acme of his virility. Youth without Beauty may
still inspire Love; not so Beauty without Youth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Health ranks next in importance. Acute disease is only a
temporary disadvantage, whereas chronic disease repels the
amorous affections, for the reason that it is likely to be transmitted
to the next generation.</p>

<p class='c001'>A fine framework or skeleton is the third desideratum. Besides
age and disease, nothing proves so fatal to the chances of
inspiring Love as deformity: “The most charming face does not
atone for it; on the contrary, even the ugliest face is preferred if
allied with a straight growth of the body.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A certain plumpness or fulness of flesh is the next thing
considered in sexual selection; for this is an indication of Health,
and promises a sound progeny. Excessive leanness is repulsive,
and so is excessive stoutness, which is often an indication of
sterility. “A well-developed bust has a magic effect on a man.”
What attracts women to men is especially muscular development,
because that is a quality in which they are commonly deficient,
and for which the children will accordingly have to rely on the
father. Women may marry an ugly man, but never one who is
unmanly.</p>

<p class='c001'>Facial beauty ranks last in importance, according to Schopenhauer.
Here too the skeleton is first considered in sexual
selection. The mouth must be small, the chin projecting, “a
slight curve of the nose, upwards or downwards, has decided the
fate of innumerable girls; and justly, for the type of the species
is at stake.” The eyes and the forehead, finally, are closely
associated with intellectual qualities.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <em>Psychic Traits.</em>—What charms women in men is preeminently
courage and energy, besides frankness and amiability.
“Stupidity is no disadvantage with women: indeed, it is more
likely that superior intellectual power, and especially genius, as
being an abnormal trait, may make an unfavourable impression on
them. Hence we so often see an ugly, stupid, and coarse man
preferred by women to a refined, clever, and amiable man.”
When women claim to have fallen in love with a man’s intellect,
it is either affectation or vanity. Wedlock is a union of hearts,
not of heads; and its object is not entertaining conversation, but
providing for the next generation. This part of Schopenhauer’s
theory is evidently an outcome of his doctrine that children inherit
their intellectual qualities from the mother, and their character
from the father. Hence the feeling that they are capable of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>supplying their children with sufficient intellect is part of the
feminine Love-instinct, and makes women indifferent to the
presence or absence of those qualities in men.</p>

<p class='c001'>It does not follow from all this that a sensible man may not
reflect on his chosen one’s character, or she on his intellectual
abilities, before marriage. Such reflection leads to marriages of
reason, but not to Love-marriages, which alone are here under
consideration.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <em>Complementary Qualities.</em>—The physical and mental attributes
considered under (1) and (2) are those which commonly
inspire Love. But there are cases where perfect Beauty is less
potent to inflame the passions than deviations from the normal
type.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ordinarily it is not the regular perfect beauties that inspire
the great passions,” says Schopenhauer; and this seems to be
borne out by the experience of Byron, who says: “I believe there
are few men who, in the course of their observations on life, have
not perceived that it is not the greatest female beauty who forms
[inspires] the longest and the strongest passions.”</p>

<p class='c001'>How is this to be accounted for? By the anxiety of Nature
(or the <em>Will</em>) to neutralise imperfections in one individual by wedding
them to another’s excesses in the opposite direction; as an
acid is neutralised by combining it with an alkali. The greater
the shortcoming the more ardent will be the infatuation if a person
is found exactly adapted for its neutralisation. The weaker a
woman is, for example, in her muscular system, the more apt will
she be to fall violently in love with an athlete. Short men have
a decided partiality for tall women, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versâ</i></span>. Blondes
almost always desire brunettes; and if the reverse does not hold
true, this is owing to the fact, he says, that the original colour
of the human complexion was not light but dark. A light complexion
has indeed become second nature to us, but less so the
other features; and “in love nature strives to return to dark hair
and brown eyes, as the primitive type.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, persons afflicted with a pug-nose take a special delight
in falcon-noses and parrot-faces; and those who are excessively
long and slim admire those who are abnormally short and even
stumpy. So with temperaments; each one preferring the opposite
to his or her own. True, if a person is quite perfect in any one
respect, he does not exactly prefer the corresponding imperfection
in another, but he is more readily reconciled to it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Throughout his essay, Schopenhauer tacitly assumes that the
parental peculiarities are fused or blended equally in the offspring,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>and that this blending is what the <em>Will</em> aims at. But on this
point Mr. Herbert Spencer has some remarks, in his essay on
“Personal Beauty,” which directly contradict Schopenhauer, of
whose theory, however, he does not seem to have been cognisant:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“The fact,” he says, "that the forms and qualities of any
offspring are not a mean between the forms and qualities of its
parents, but a mixture of them, is illustrated in every family.
The features and peculiarities of a child are separately referred by
observers to father and mother respectively—nose and mouth to
this side; colour of the hair and eyes to that; this moral peculiarity
to the first; this intellectual one to the second—and so with
contour and idiosyncrasies of body. Manifestly, if each organ or
faculty in a child was an average of the two developments of such
organ or faculty in the parents, it would follow that all brothers
and sisters should be alike; or should, at any rate, differ no more
than their parents differed from year to year. So far, however,
from finding that this is the case, we find not only that great
irregularities are produced by intermixture of traits, but that there
is no constancy in the mode of intermixture, or the extent of variations
produced by it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This imperfect union of parental constitutions in the constitution
of offspring is yet more clearly illustrated by the reappearance
of peculiarities traceable to bygone generations. Forms, dispositions,
and diseases, possessed by distant progenitors, habitually
come out from time to time in descendants. Some single feature,
or some solitary tendency, will again and again show itself after
being apparently lost. It is notoriously thus with gout, scrofula,
and insanity.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, unite a pure race “with another equally pure, but
adapted to different conditions and having a correspondingly different
physique, face, and morale, and there will occur in the
descendants not a homogeneous mean between the two constitutions,
but a seemingly irregular combination of characteristics of
the one with characteristics of the other—one feature traceable to
this race, a second to that, and a third uniting the attributes of
both; while in disposition and intellect there will be found a like
medley of the two originals.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The fact that the more remote ancestry must be taken into
account besides the parents, in considering the traits of the offspring,
is one which Mr. Galton has done much to emphasise, and
which Schopenhauer completely ignores. It tells against the
metaphysical part of his theory; for all the efforts of the <em>Will</em>
to merge opposite characters into homogeneous traits must prove
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>futile if a blue-eyed man, for instance, who marries a black-eyed
girl, finds that their children have neither the father’s blue nor the
mother’s black, but the grandmother’s gray eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet in the long run diverse traits of figure and physiognomy
do tend to a harmonious fusion. Though a man with a prominent
nose, which he inherited from his father, is likely to transmit it
to his son, though his wife may have a snub-nose, yet there will
be a slight modification even in the son’s organ; and if the son
keeps up the tradition of marrying a snub-nosed girl, and his
children follow his example, the chances are that in a few generations
the nose of that family will be a feature of moderate size and
classic proportions. The very fact emphasised by Mr. Galton that
all the ancestral influences count, will here aid the ultimate fusion.
Conspicuous instances of the long-continued prevalence of a particular
nose—or other feature—may be accounted for by the fact
that other kinds of that organ were rare in the vicinity, or that
marriage was decided by so many other considerations that the
dimensions of one organ could not come into consideration, much
as the bride or groom might have preferred an improvement in
that respect.</p>

<p class='c001'>So far as Schopenhauer’s theory concerns only the fact that
Love is apt to be based on complementary qualities, he is doubtless
correct; but it needs no erratic metaphysical fetish, as a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>deus
ex machina</i></span>, to account for that fact. A simple application of
psychologic principles explains the whole mystery.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first place, nothing could be more remote from the truth
than the cynical notion that every woman considers herself a
Venus. She may, on the whole, consider herself equal to the
average of Beauty; but if she has any special fault—a mouth too
large or too small, an upper lip too high, a nose too flat or too
prominent, too much or too little flesh, excessive height or shortness—she
is not only conscious of the defect, but morbidly conscious
of it, and uses every possible device to conceal it. Thus
constantly brooding over her misfortune her mind, by a natural
reaction, will conceive a special admiration for an organ that
exceeds the line of Beauty in the opposite direction. Every day
one hears a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>petite</i></span> girl admiring a specially tall woman; and this
admiration will prompt her, other things being equal, to fall in
love with a tall man.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, familiarity breeds indifference to one’s own charms,
and a disposition to admire what we lack ourselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>Novelty comes into play. A Northern blonde among a nation
of brunettes cannot fail to slay hearts by the hundred, while the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>mystic flashes of a Spanish woman’s black eyes are fatal to every
Northern visitor.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nations, like individuals, admire and desire what they lack.
The Germans and the English are deficient in grace—hence that
quality is what chiefly charms them in the French, who have
much more of it than of Beauty, and in the Spanish. Byron was
so much smitten with the sun-mellowed complexions and the
graceful proportions and gait of the Spanish maidens, that he
became quite unjust to his own lovely countrywomen—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Who round the North for paler dames would seek?</div>
      <div class='line'>How poor their forms appear! How languid, wan, and weak!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Were savages susceptible to Love, it might be suggested that
their practice of exogamy, or marrying a woman from another
tribe, had something to do with their admiration of novelty and
complementary qualities; but we know that they do not admire
such qualities, but only such typical traits as prevail among their
own women, and these, moreover, in an exaggerated form. This
is one reason why savages are so ugly. They have no Romantic
Love to improve their Personal Beauty by fusing heterogeneous
defects into homogeneous perfections.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus we may freely endorse Schopenhauer’s doctrine regarding
the benefits derived by the offspring (ultimately, in several generations)
from marriages based on complementary Love, without
bowing down before his fetish—a fetish which appears doubly
objectionable because it is old-fashioned; <i>i.e.</i> it strives to “maintain
the type of the species in its primitive purity,” whereas
modern science teaches that this “primitive type” of human
beauty had a very simian aspect.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor need we at all accept the pessimistic aspect of his theory—the
notion that Love is an illusion, and that Love-marriages
commonly end unhappily, the lover sacrificing himself for his
progeny.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Herbert Spencer, in his <cite>Sociology</cite>, elaborates an idea which
so curiously leads up to this phase of Schopenhauer’s doctrine that
it must be briefly referred to for its evolutionary suggestiveness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the lowest animals—the microscopic protozoa—the
individual, as he remarks, is sacrificed after a few hours of life,
by breaking up into two new individuals, or into a number of
germs which produce a new generation. The parents are here
entirely sacrificed to the interests of the young and the species.
As we ascend in the scale of life this sacrifice of parents to the
young and the species becomes less and less prevalent. Among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>birds, for instance, “The lives of the parents are but partially
subordinated at times when the young are being reared. And
then there are long intervals between breeding-seasons, during
which the lives of parents are carried on for their own sakes....
In proportion as organisms become higher in their structures and
powers, they are individually less sacrificed to the maintenance of
the species; and the implication is that in the highest type of
man this sacrifice is reduced to a minimum.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here is the point where Schopenhauer, had he been an evolutionist,
might have dovetailed his theory with Spencer’s, by saying
that in man it is no longer the life of the individual, or most of
his time, that is sacrificed, but merely his conjugal happiness,
which the Love-instinct induces him unconsciously to barter for
the superior physical and mental beauty of his offspring.</p>

<p class='c001'>Unfortunately, Schopenhauer did not take any pains to verify
his theory by testing it by vulgar facts. There are plenty of
unhappy marriages, but no one who will search his memory can
fail to come to the conclusion that the vast majority of them are
cases where money or rank and not Love supplied the motive of
an unsympathetic union. Though Conjugal Affection consists of
a different group of emotions from Romantic Love, yet there is an
affinity between them; and it is not likely that Conjugal Love
will ever supervene where before marriage there was an entire
absence of sympathy and adoration. Even an imprudent Love-match
which leads to poverty—is it not preferable to a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>mariage
de convenance</i></span>, which leads to lifelong indifference and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ennui</i></span>?
Is it not better to have one month of ecstatic bliss in life than to
live and die without ever knowing life’s highest rapture?</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, the French marry for money and social convenience,
and their children are ugly; the Americans marry for Love, and
have the most beautiful children in the world. Is it not more
conducive to conjugal happiness to know that one has lovely
children and that the race is increasing, than to have ugly children
and to know that the race is dying out?</p>

<p class='c001'>Love-matches would never end unhappily if the lovers would
take proper care of their own happiness by transfusing the habits
of Courtship into conjugal life, as elsewhere explained in this
book.</p>

<p class='c001'>Schopenhauer’s whole argument is vitiated by the fact that it
is chiefly the physical complementary qualities that inspire Love,
not the mental—the latter, in fact, being barely noticed by him.
Mental divergence might indeed occasionally lead to an unhappy
marriage, but physical divergence—the fact that he is large and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>blond, she small and a brunette—cannot possibly lead to matrimonial
discord. This knocks the whole bottom out of Schopenhauer’s
erotic pessimism. The only sense in which Love is an
illusion is in its Hyperbolic phase—the notion that the beloved is
superior to all other mortals; and that is a very harmless illusion.</p>

<p class='c001'>Schopenhauer’s pessimism, it should be added, is greatly mitigated
by the poetic halo of martyrdom with which he invests the
lover’s head. Society and public opinion, he points out, applaud
him for instinctively preferring the welfare of the next generation
to his own comfort. “For is not the exact determination of the
individualities of the next generation a much higher and nobler
object than those ecstatic feelings of the lovers, and their super-sensual
soap-bubbles?” It is this that invests Love with its
poetic character. There is one thing only that justifies tears in a
man, and that is the loss of his Love, for in that he bewails not
his own loss but the loss of the species.</p>

<p class='c001'>Apart from the suggestive details of his essay, Schopenhauer’s
merit and originality lies, first, in his having pointed out that
Love becomes more intense the more it is individualised; secondly,
in emphasising the fact that in match-making it is not the happiness
of the to-be-married couple that should be chiefly consulted, but
the consequences of their union to the offspring; thirdly, in
dwelling on the important truth that Love is a cause of Beauty,
because its aim always is either to perpetuate existing Beauty
through hereditary transmission, or to create new Beauty by
fusing two imperfect individuals into a being in whom their short-comings
mutually neutralise one another.</p>

<p class='c001'>Love, however, is only one source of Personal Beauty. Personal
Beauty has four sources; and these must now be considered
in succession, in the order which roughly indicates their successive
evolution—Health, Crossing, Love, and Mental Refinement.</p>

<p class='c001'>The remainder of this work will be devoted exclusively to the
subject of Personal Beauty, as it influences and is influenced by
Romantic Love. And here, as in the preceding pages, I shall
always cite the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ipsissima verba</i></span> of the greatest specialists who
have written on any particular branch of this subject.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>FOUR SOURCES OF BEAUTY</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>I.—HEALTH</h3>

<p class='c013'><em>Plants, Animals, Savages.</em>—In two of the most exquisite
passages, not only in his own works, but in all English literature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>Mr. Ruskin has emphasised the dependence of physical beauty in
plants on their healthy appearance, and the independence of this
beauty on any idea of direct utility to man.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is a matter of easy demonstration,” he says, “that, setting
the characters of typical beauty aside, the pleasure afforded by
every organic form is in proportion to its appearance of healthy
vital energy; as in a rose-bush, setting aside all considerations of
gradated flushing of colour and fair folding of line, which it shares
with the cloud or the snow-wreath, we find in and through all this
certain signs pleasant and acceptable as signs of life and enjoyment
in the particular individual plant itself. Every leaf and stalk is
seen to have a function, to be constantly exercising that function,
and, as it seems, <em>solely</em> for the good and enjoyment of the plant.
It is true that reflection will show us that the plant is not living
for itself alone, that its life is one of benefaction, that it gives as
well as receives, but no sense of this whatever mingles with our
perception of physical beauty in its forms. Those forms which
appear to be necessary to its health, the symmetry of its leaflets,
the smoothness of its stalks, the vivid green of its shoots, are
looked upon by us as signs of the plant’s own happiness and perfection;
they are useless to us, except as they give us pleasure in
our sympathising with that of the plant, and if we see a leaf
withered or shrunk or worm-eaten, we say it is ugly, and feel it
to be most painful, not because it hurts <em>us</em>, but because it seems
to hurt the plant, and conveys to us an idea of pain and disease
and failure of life in <em>it</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The bending tree, waving to and fro in the wind above the
waterfall, is beautiful because it is happy, though it is perfectly
useless to us. The same trunk, hewn down and thrown across the
stream, has lost its beauty. It serves as a bridge,—it has become
useful; it lives not for itself, and its beauty is gone, or what it
retains is purely typical, dependent on its lines and colours, not its
functions. Saw it into planks, and though now adapted to become
permanently useful, its whole beauty is lost for ever, or to be
regained only in part when decay and ruin shall have withdrawn
it again from use, and left it to receive from the hand of Nature
the velvet moss and varied lichen, which may again suggest ideas
of inherent happiness, and tint its mouldering sides with hues of
life.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the animal world we find the same dependence of Beauty
upon Health. As Mr. Wallace has shown, “colour and ornament
are strictly correlated with health, vigour, and general fitness to
survive.” It is the superior vitality, vigour, and vivacity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>certain male animals that leads the choicest females to prefer them
to others less favoured; and thus it happens that, thanks to the
dependence of Beauty on Health, animals have become more and
more beautiful. Moreover, it is Love in its primitive form that
urges animals to prefer those that are most healthy. And thus
we have the three great agents acting and reacting upon one
another. Health produces Beauty, and together they inspire Love;
while Love selects Health, and thus preserves and multiplies
Beauty. But this whole subject has been so fully discussed in the
chapter on Love among Animals that it is needless to recapitulate
the facts here.</p>

<p class='c001'>Concerning savages, there is a prevalent notion that, owing to
their free and easy life in the forests, they are healthier on the
average than civilised mankind. As a matter of fact, however,
they are as inferior to us in Health as in Beauty. Their constant
exposure and irregular feeding habits, their neglect and ignorance
of every hygienic law, in conjunction with their vicious lives, their
arbitrary mutilations of various parts, and their selection of inferior
forms, prevent their bodies from assuming the regular and delicate
proportions which we regard as essential to Beauty. They arrive
at maturity at an earlier age, and lose their vitality sooner than
we do. “Decrepitude,” says Dr. Topinard, “shows itself sooner
in some races than in others. The Australians and Bosjesmans
are old men at a period when the European is in the full enjoyment
of his faculties, both physical and intellectual. The Japanese
the same, according to Dr. Krishaber, physician to the Japanese
embassy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Women everywhere pay less attention to the laws of Health
than men. They have less exercise, less fresh air and sunshine
than men. Hence, although the most beautiful women are more
beautiful than the handsomest men, yet in probably every country
of the world the average man is a more perfect specimen of
masculine than the average woman of feminine Beauty. Concerning
savages, Mr. Spencer says: “Very generally among the lower
races the females are even more unattractive in aspect than the
males. It is remarked of the Puttooahs, whose men are diminutive
and whose women are still more so, that ‘the men are far from
being handsome, but the palm of ugliness must be awarded to the
women.’ The latter are <em>hard-worked</em> and apparently <em>ill-fed</em>.”
Again, of the inhabitants of the Corea Gutzlaff says: “The females
are very ugly, whilst the male sex is one of the best formed of
Asia.... Women are <em>treated like beasts of burden</em>.” Many
similar cases are cited by Dr. Ploss in <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Das Weib</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>Concerning modern civilised nations a well-known art-critic has
given his testimony to the effect that “Possibly owing to the fact
that men are freer to follow their normal lives, I have found that
in a majority of the countries I have visited there are more handsome
men than beautiful women. This is peculiarly the case with
the modern Greek, and was, if antique sculpture could be accepted
as witness, with the ancient.”</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Greek Beauty.</em>—In the preceding chapters of this work an
attempt has been made to show that there is a general connection
between the growth of Love and the growth of Beauty throughout
the world. To some readers, no doubt, the thought has suggested
itself, “How, if this be true, did the loveless Greeks succeed in
reaching such uncommon physical beauty—beauty which artists of
all times have admired?”</p>

<p class='c001'>It must be borne in mind, however, that we are very liable to
exaggerate in our notions of Greek Beauty, because we are apt to
generalise from the fine statues that have come down to us, and
to imagine that they represent the common type of Greek Beauty.
But it is well known that the Greeks idealised their statues
according to certain physiognomic rules; and, moreover, as
Winckelmann remarks, “Beauty was not a general quality even
among the Greeks, and Cotta in <cite>Cicero</cite> says that, among the great
numbers of young persons at Athens, there were only a few possessing
true beauty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides, it has not been claimed that Love is the <em>only</em> cause of
Beauty. Taking into consideration the other sources of Beauty, it
is easy enough to account for such physical attractiveness as the
Greeks did possess. The intellectual culture which the men
enjoyed gave them a great advantage over the women; and equally
important, if not more so, was the attention which the men (and
in some cases the women too) paid to Health. Their habitual life
in the open air, while the women were locked up at home, combined
with their daily gymnastic exercises in making their complexion
healthy, their eyes sparkling, their limbs supple, vigorous, and
graceful.</p>

<p class='c001'>Other causes that tended to keep up an average of healthy
bodily development were the refusal to bring up sickly and deformed
infants, and the existence of numerous slaves, who did all the
drudgery for the Greeks.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is most characteristic that the author of a very old Greek
ode formulates his wishes in this order: First, health; then,
beauty; thirdly, wealth honestly got; fourth, the privilege of
being gay and merry with his friends.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>First, Health; then, Beauty. There lies the secret, for they
always go together; and in aiming at one the Greeks got the
other too.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was every reason why Greek parents should have striven
eagerly to follow those laws of Health which ensure beautiful
children. In ancient Greece Beauty was a possession which led
to national fame. Some persons, Winckelmann informs us, were
even characterised by a particular name, borrowed from some
specially fine feature. Thus Demetrius Poliorketes was named,
from the beauty of his eyelids, χαριτοβλέφαρος <i>i.e.</i> on whose lids
the graces dwell.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It appears, indeed,” the same writer continues, "to have
been a belief that the procreation of beautiful children might be
promoted by the distribution of prizes for beauty, as there is reason
to infer from the contests of beauty which were instituted in the
remotest ages by Cypselus, King of Arcadia, in the time of the
Heraclidæ, on the banks of the river Alpheus, in Elis; and also
from the fact that at the festival of the Philesian Apollo, a prize
for the most exquisite kiss was conferred on the youthful. Its
assignment was subject to the decision of a judge, as was probably
also the case at Megara, at the tomb of Diocles.</p>

<p class='c001'>“At Sparta, and at Lesbos, in the temple of Juno, and among
the citizens of Parrhasia, the women contended for the prize of
beauty. The regard for this quality was so strong that, as Oppian
declares, the Spartan women placed in their sleeping-rooms an
Apollo, or Bacchus, or Nereus, or Narcissus, or Hyacinthus, or
Castor and Pollux, in order that they might bear beautiful
children.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Some hint as to what the Greeks regarded as beautiful is given
by the epithets Homer bestows on Helen—"the well-rounded"
“the white-armed,” “fair-haired,” “of the beautiful cheeks.”</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Mediæval Ugliness.</em>—This is a topic which might as well be
introduced under any of the other Sources of Beauty, for it is
difficult to say which of these sources was most completely and
deliberately choked up during the Dark Ages.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a curious irony of language that makes asceticism almost
identical with æstheticism, of which it is the deadly enemy. As
diseases are transmitted from generation to generation, so it seems
that the fear of Beauty born of mediæval asceticism has not yet
died out completely; for it is related that some years ago a pious
dame in Boston seriously meditated the duty of having some of
her daughter’s sound teeth pulled out, so as to mitigate her sinful
Beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>If this worthy lady had followed St. Jerome’s injunction—"I
entirely forbid a young lady to bathe"; if she had taught her that
it is unladylike to have a healthy appetite; if she had locked her
up in a house rendered pestilential by defective drainage; allowed
her mind to rot in fallow idleness; taught her that to be really
saintly and virtuous she must be pale and hysterical; or imitated
the lady who was praised by a bishop in the fourth century for
“having brought upon herself a swarm of diseases which defied all
medical skill to cure,”—if the worthy Boston lady had but followed
this mediæval system, she would have succeeded in a short time
in overcoming her daughter’s sinful Beauty, and making her “ugly
as a mud-fence,” as they say out West.</p>

<p class='c001'>That Personal Beauty cannot flourish where Health is regarded
as a vice and Disease as a virtue is self-evident. And one needs
only to look at mediæval pictures to note how coarse and void
of refined expression are the men, how hard and masculine the
women. The faces of the numerous mediæval women in Planché’s
<cite>Cyclopædia of Costume</cite> have almost all an expression approaching
imbecility, and features as if they had been chiselled by a small
boy trying his hand at sculpture for the first time. Thackeray
does not hesitate to speak even of “those simpering Madonnas of
Rafael.” Mr. G. A. Simcox remarks that in manuscripts of the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries (like the Harleian Gospels and
Maccabees) we meet with “short, thickset figures, mostly with
the long, square, horsey face, moving stiffly in small groups, in
heavy dresses; and even the daughter of Herodias dances upon
her head [<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sic</i></span>] in a gown that might have stood alone. On the
other hand, the faces are more set, more articulate, less flabby,
though they are all mean, or almost all, and look askance out of
the corners of their eyes” (<cite>Art Journal</cite>, 1874, p. 58).</p>

<p class='c001'>There may be Oriental countries where woman is kept more
closely under lock and key than she was in Europe during the
Dark Ages; but nowhere else has man so well succeeded in reducing
the pursuit of unhappiness to a science, in snubbing, scorning,
abusing, maltreating woman. How all this must have tended to
increase Personal Beauty is well brought out in the following
advice given by Mr. Ruskin: “Do not think you can make a girl
lovely if you do not make her happy. There is not one restraint
you put on a good girl’s nature—there is not one check you give
to her instincts of affection or of effort—which will not be indelibly
written on her features, with a hardness which is all the
more painful because it takes away the brightness from the eyes
of innocence, and the charm from the brow of virtue.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span><em>Modern Hygiene.</em>—Disease is Beauty’s deadliest enemy. Yet
for the sake of gratifying a silly vanity—for the sake of being
distinguished from ordinary mortals—a certain pallor and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>blasé</i></span>
languor have long been considered in certain influential circles as
more <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>distingué</i></span> than ruddy cheeks and robust health. Yet even
if pale cheeks were more beautiful than rosy cheeks, would it be
worth while to purchase them at the cost of premature decay—of
the certainty that a <em>few</em> years of pale cheeks will be followed by
<em>many</em> years of sallow cheeks and lack-lustre eyes, deeply sunk into
their orbits?</p>

<p class='c001'>Though beauty is still of lamentably rare occurrence in every
country, there is infinitely more of it than during the Middle
Ages; and certainly not the least cause of this is the increased
attention paid to Hygiene—public and personal. The difference
in this respect between us and our ancestors is well brought out
by the statistics regarding the average length of life. In ancient
Rome, it is stated, "the average longevity among the most favoured
classes was but thirty years, whereas to-day the average longevity
among the corresponding class of people is fifty years. In the
sixteenth century the average longevity in Geneva was 21·21
years. Between 1814 and 1833 it was 40·68, and as large a
proportion now live to seventy as lived to forty-three three
hundred years ago." Dr. Corfield, comparing the statistics of
1842 with those of 1884, states that the mean duration of life in
London has increased from twenty-nine to thirty-eight years. “In
the reign of Queen Elizabeth the death-rate of the metropolis as it
then was amounted to 40 per thousand. In the reign of Queen
Victoria, almost entirely by the reduction of mortality by means
of improved drainage, ventilation, and water, it has often touched
15 and 14, and even fallen as low as 13 in the thousand,” while
“in many of the suburban districts, and in the fashionable region
about Hyde Park it ranges from 11 to 12.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In France, according to M. Topinard, the mean duration of
life, which was twenty-nine at the close of the eighteenth century,
and thirty-nine from 1817 to 1831, increased to forty from 1840
to 1859, thanks to the progress of sanitary science and civilisation.</p>

<p class='c001'>As Hygiene is receiving more and more attention every year, it is
possible that in course of time Dr. W. B. Richardson’s ideal will
be realised—a town ideally perfect in sanitary matters, having a
death-rate of 9 per 1000, and 105 years the duration of a man’s life.</p>

<p class='c001'>As decrepitude and premature old age means a premature loss
of Beauty, personal attractiveness would be correspondingly prolonged
and increased with life itself.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>Even at the present time not one house in a thousand is so
constructed that every room has good ventilation. Architects
are, however, less to blame than the people who will persist in
their absurd old superstition that draughts and night air are injurious.
Professor Reclam, the distinguished hygienist, not long
ago opened a crusade against the horror of night air and draughts
which is especially prevalent among his countrymen. “Sleeping
with open windows,” he says, “is most unjustly decried among the
people, as well as night air in general. But night air is injurious
only in swampy regions, whereas on dry soil, in the mountains, and
everywhere in the upper stories of a house it is <em>more salubrious
than day air</em>.... Draughts are not injurious unless we are in a
glow. To healthy persons they <em>cannot possibly do so much harm
as the stagnant air in a close room</em>. The fear of draughts is entirely
groundless, though it affects most people in a manner which
is simply ludicrous.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Electricity, no doubt, will in less than a decade abolish horses
from our cities, and with them the dust, foul odours, and sleep-murdering
noise. The gain to Health, and through it to Beauty,
from this alone, will be enormous. Doubtless one of the reasons
why there is so much Beauty, so many fresh and sparkling eyes, in
Venice, is because there are no horses in that city, and the inhabitants
are not roused and half-roused from sleep every fifteen minutes
during the night by a waggon rattling down the street.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not sufficiently known that street-noise may injure the
Health even of those whom it does not entirely wake up. The
restorative value of sleep lies in its depth and the absence of dreams.
A noisy waggon interferes with the depth of sleep and starts a
current of dreams, thus depriving it of half its potency.</p>

<p class='c001'>“<em>Beauty sleep</em>” is an expression which rests on a real physiological
truth. Sleep before midnight really is more health-giving and
beautifying than after midnight, for the reason that in all towns
and cities there is less noise in the early hours of the night than
after four in the morning, wherefore sleep is deeper between ten
and twelve than between six and eight o’clock. The reason why
so many more proposals (by city folks) are made in the country
than in the city is not only because there are more frequent opportunities
of meeting at a summer hotel, but because the young folks
retire early, and appear in the morning with an exuberance of
Health, born of fresh air and sound sleep, which cannot fail to
inspire Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>Other matters of Hygiene will be discussed in connection with
the organs which they specially concern.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>II.—CROSSING</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Darwin has proved experimentally that in the vegetable kingdom
“cross-fertilisation is generally beneficial, and self-fertilisation
injurious. This is shown by the difference in height, weight, constitutional
vigour, and fertility of the offspring from crossed and
self-fertilised flowers, and in the number of seeds produced by the
parent plants.” He also showed that “the benefit from cross-fertilisation
depends on the plants which are crossed having been
subjected during previous generations to somewhat different conditions.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Similarly, concerning animals, we read in Topinard, that
“breeders who select their subjects with a definite object to breed
<em>in and in</em>, that is to say, between near relations, rapidly obtain
excellent results. They know, however, that fertility then diminishes,
and that it will cease altogether if they do not have recourse
from time to time to crossing, in order to <em>strengthen the race</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But both in the vegetable and the animal kingdom, as we have
seen, superior Health also implies superior Beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'>The inference is natural that the human race also must be
benefited by marriages of individuals of different races, or of the
same race, but brought up under different conditions of life. And
the facts are entirely in favour of this supposition, as are the best
authorities in Anthropology. Dr. Topinard gives the following
instances among many others: “Immigration into the United
States, which has taken so considerable a flight during the last
thirty years, has already been enormous. Every variety of cross
has been going on between English, Irish, Germans, Italians,
French, etc., with the greatest possible success. We may also
mention numberless Spaniards from the Peninsula, among whom
are found the features of the Saracen invaders of the ninth century;
then that population on the Barbary coast, called Moors,
and which is a medley of races of every description, the Arab and
Berber blood predominating. On tracing back the yellow races,
we also discover a perfect eugenesis.... De Mas speaks in the
highest terms of mixed breeds of Chinese and Mongolians, and
MM. Mondières and Morice of those of Chinese and Annamites
under the name of Minuongs. Dr. Bowring describes a race in
the Philippine Islands, intermediate between the Malays and
Chinese, as the principal agent of civilisation in these latitudes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, “it is undeniable that in Africa the Negro
races do not cross to any great extent.” Nor has any one ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>accused the Negroes of an excessive amount of Beauty. Whereas
in Lima, which has the finest women in South America, “there
are twenty-three different names to designate the varieties of
mixed breeds of Spaniards, Peruvians, and Negroes.” “The number
of mongrels on the face of the globe has been estimated at
twelve millions, of whom no fewer than eleven millions are in
South America.” South American women are already famous for
their Beauty, and there is reason to believe that when the fusion
of all these elements is complete the race will be one of the finest
in the world. What Beauty it has now seems to be owing chiefly
to the magic of Crossing; for attention to Health there is little
but what comes from life in the open air; while Romantic Love is
perhaps as rare as Mental Refinement, inasmuch as Courtship is
not so free and easy a matter as in North America. All the more
honour to the potency of Crossing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Take a few more cases. The African Negroes, as just stated,
do not mix much, and are an ugly type. Among the Polynesians,
on the other hand, there are many very fine types of human
beauty; and it is therefore not surprising to read that to-day in
Polynesia, “mixed breeds are so numerous that it would be difficult
to find among them any individuals of pure race.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, concerning the Magyars or Hungarians, Schweiger-Lerchenfeld
remarks that “they are a splendid race, physically
and intellectually.... The girls and young women are of most
piquant charm, models of health in mind and body.” But these
Magyars, when they first came to Europe, were, as Waitz states,
“of a repulsive ugliness in the eyes of all their neighbours.” That
they have mixed with the Indo-Germanic type is shown by their
appearance, as well as by peculiarities of their language. “Where
they have probably remained less mixed,” Waitz continues, “and
at the same time less cultivated, in some remote regions, especially
in the mountains, the ugly primitive type may be found to the
present day; in the plains may be found every transitional form
from this to the nobler type; at Szegedin both are found face to
face.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magyars, in turn, have, like the Slavo-Italians, Czechs,
etc., assisted the Austrians in evolving a superior type of Beauty
by fusing with them. That there is very much more Beauty in
Vienna than in any purely German city is an almost proverbial
commonplace; and the reason why may be found in the statistics:
in Germany 31·80 per cent are blond, 14·05 brunet, 54·15 mixed;
in Austria 19·59 per cent are blond, 23·17 brunet, and 68·04
mixed.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>The European Turks have much nobler forms of the head and
features than their Asiatic relatives; and the inference seems inevitable
that they owe these improvements to intermarriage with
Circassian women.</p>

<p class='c001'>A negative instance, showing the disadvantages of abstaining
from Crossing, is given by the Jews. There are handsome Jews
and, up to a certain age, very beautiful Jewesses. But the typical
Jew is certainly not a thing of beauty. The disadvantages of
Jewish separatism are shown not only in the long, thick, crooked
nose, the bloated lips, almost suggesting a negro, and the heavy
lower eyelid, but in the fact that the Jews “have proportionately
more insane, deaf mutes, blind, and colour-blind” than other
Europeans. From an intellectual and industrial point of view, the
Jews are one of the finest races in the world, and their absorption
by the natives of the countries in which they have settled could
not but benefit both parties concerned. From this point of view
there may be something said even in favour of the money-marriages,
which are now so frequent between extravagant German officers
and Jewish heiresses. Unfortunately, the Jews have kept apart
so long from the rest of the world that they do not readily mix
with non-Jews. Contrary to the general rule, mixed marriages of
Jews and Christians are less fertile than pure Jewish unions.</p>

<p class='c001'>The precise manner in which a mixture of races improves physical
appearance is a question still open to debate. Professor
Kollmann (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Plastische Anatomie</cite></span>) thinks “the result of the crossing
of two forms is comparable, not to a chemical, but to a mechanical
mixture”; and this agrees with the view of Mr. Herbert Spencer,
who endeavours to trace to this fact the frequent want of correspondence
between intellectual and physical beauty. He believes,
however, the time will come “when the present causes of incongruity
will have worked themselves out,” and intellectual beauty
emerge in harmony with physical, in all details, as it no doubt
exists in general.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no lack of facts supporting the view that sexual fusion
is a mere mechanical mixture. The “Bourbon nose” seems to
defy mitigating circumstances for generations; and “M. de Quatrefages
knew a great-grandson of the bailiff of Suffren who was
a striking likeness of his ancestor after four generations, and who,
nevertheless, bore no resemblance either to his father or his mother.”
A child may resemble its father, mother, aunt, uncle, grand-parents,
or several of them at once; and the resemblance may vary
at different ages.</p>

<p class='c001'>More extraordinary are the following cases cited by Topinard:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>“Sometimes the child possesses altogether the character of one
or other parent: for example, the child of a European father and
a Chinese mother, Dr. Scherzer says, is altogether a European or
altogether a Chinese. A Berber with blue eyes and with the lobule
of the ear absent, married to a dark Arab woman with a well-formed
ear, had two children, one like himself, the other like his
wife. An English officer, fair, with blue eyes and florid complexion,
had several children by an Indian negress. Some were the
image of the father, others exactly like the mother.... A
decided negro, having had a white among his ancestors, has unexpectedly
a child with a white skin by a negress.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet all these are exceptional cases, which, like the winning
number in a lottery, get a disproportionate amount of attention.
Moreover, this “mechanical” form of assimilation seems to occur
chiefly where very unrelated races are fused, and then especially in
the first generation. In subsequent generations the union doubtless
tends to become more and more chemical—no longer a negro
character floating on a white one, like oil on water, but a mixture,
as of wine and water.</p>

<p class='c001'>Take the American quadroons, for instance, famous for their
beauty of form and features. They are mongrels of the third
generation, having one-eighth black, seven-eighths white blood in
their veins. Surely these characters are not “mechanically”
mixed in such a woman, but “chemically.” That is, you do not
find her with the eyes and nose of a negro, the lips and ears of a
white, one part of her skin dark the other light: but in everything
there is a fusion of the ancestral elements. Her nose is not flat
like that of her ancestress, nor her lips swollen, but both are
intermediate between those of her white and black ancestors.
Her lip is still thicker than that of the whites, and that gives her
a sensuous aspect, kiss-inviting. Her eyes, again, have lost the
fierce glare and opaque blackness of the negro-grandmother, and
assumed a more crystalline, tender lustre; while their form and
surroundings have become more refined and expressive. All this
is homogeneous fusion, not “heterogeneous mixture.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Finally, it is hardly correct to state dogmatically that a certain
person resembles this or that ancestor. In nothing else do opinions
vary so constantly and so ludicrously. No one who has ever been
“trotted around” among his relatives in the “old country,” can
have failed to be amused at the countless resemblances to this and
that uncle, aunt, or grand-parent discovered in him, until he came
to the conclusion that he must be a veritable epitome of the whole
genealogy. A man who at home is supposed to be absolutely unlike
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>his brother, is elsewhere mistaken for him and addressed as
such; while another man finds a friend who knew his father in
his youth, and declares he is exactly like him; though a second
friend who knew only the mother, claims a similar hereditary
influence for her. All of which tends to show that there is more
of both parents in each person than is commonly supposed; and
that the reason why opinions differ so, is because the fusion
is chemical rather than mechanical, which makes it difficult to put
the finger on distinct points of resemblance.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is in the more closely allied races, like the English and German,
or Italian and Spanish, that “chemical” fusion is most
readily attained, and Beauty most rapidly evolved. Such are the
unions which take place on such a large scale in the United States
and Canada; and this may account for the fact that there is more
Beauty in North America than in South America, where the races
that intermingle are less related. There is a golden mean here as
in everything else.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>III.—ROMANTIC LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>What Crossing does on a national scale, Love continues with
individuals, by fusing dissonant, but complementary, parental
qualities into a harmonious progeny. How this is done is sufficiently
shown in the chapter on Schopenhauer.</p>

<p class='c001'>This, however, is only one of the ways in which Love increases
the amount of Beauty in the world. There are several others.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second is that—apart from complementary considerations—Romantic
Love always urges the choice of a mate who approaches
nearest to the ideal type of Beauty. As Beauty is hereditary, and
as a beautiful father and mother may have six or more beautiful
children, this predilection for Beauty shown by Love necessarily
preserves and multiplies it—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“From fairest creatures we desire increase,</div>
      <div class='line'>That thereby Beauty’s rose might never die,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>says Shakspere, anticipating the modern theory of heredity.</p>

<p class='c001'>On this particular topic nothing more need be said here, because
all the remainder of this book will be taken up with a consideration
of those features of Personal Beauty for which the æsthetic
taste which forms part of Romantic Love shows a decided preference.</p>

<p class='c001'>The third way in which Love promotes the cause of Beauty is
by the great attention it pays to Health in its choice. For though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>Health is not always synonymous with Beauty, it is the soil on
which alone Beauty can germinate and flourish.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fourth way is through the elimination of ugliness. Love,
says Plato, is devotion to Beauty: <a id='corr323.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='‘with'>“with</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_323.4'><ins class='correction' title='‘with'>“with</ins></a></span> the ugly Eros has no
concern.”</p>

<p class='c001'>From the æsthetic point of view, ugliness is disease. Now
there is a cast-iron Lykurgean law prevailing throughout Nature
which eliminates the diseased and the ugly. It is a cruel agency,
called Natural Selection, and has not the slightest regard for individuals,
but provides only for the weal of the species, as Schopenhauer
erroneously says is the case with Love. In a bed of plants,
if there are more than can find sustenance, the stronger crowd out
the weaker. Among animals, wherever there is competition, the
best-developed, handsomest lion survives in combat, and the most
fleet-footed, and consequently most graceful, deer escapes, while the
clumsy, the ugly, and diseased perish miserably, inexorably.
Savages leave the old and feeble to die, and weak or deformed
children are either deliberately put out of the way or perish from
want of proper care. Nor among the ancient civilised nations were
such methods unknown. Plato and Aristotle, says Mr. Grote,
agree in this point: “Both of them command that no child born
crippled or deformed shall be brought up—a practice actually
adopted at Sparta under the Lykurgean Institutions, and even
carried further, since no child was allowed to be brought up until
it had been inspected and approved by the public nurses.” The
Romans, too, were legally permitted to expose deformed children.</p>

<p class='c001'>Christianity, the religion of pity and charity, abhors such
practices. Christianity is antagonistic to Natural Selection. One
of its chief functions is the building of hospitals in which the
cripples, the insane, the incurably diseased, are gratuitously and
tenderly cared for, instead of being allowed to perish, as they
would under the sway of Natural Selection.</p>

<p class='c001'>This artificial preservation of disease and deformity, in and out
of hospitals, due to Christian charity, might in the long run prove
injurious to the welfare of the human race, were it not for the
stepping in of Modern Love as a preserver of Health and Beauty.
What formerly was left to the agency of Natural Selection is now
done by Love, through Sexual Selection, on a vast scale.</p>

<p class='c001'>From a moral point of view, the substitution of Sexual for
Natural Selection is a great gain, in harmony with the spirit of
Christianity. For Cupid does not <em>kill</em> those who do not come up
to his standard of Health and Beauty, but simply ignores and
condemns them to a life of single-blessedness.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>IV.—MENTAL REFINEMENT</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“After all,” says Washington Irving, speaking of Spanish
women, “it is the divinity <em>within</em> which makes the divinity <em>without</em>;
and I have been more fascinated by a woman of talent and
intelligence, though deficient in personal charms, than I have been
by the most regular beauty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is one of the commonest commonplaces of conversation that
in moments of intellectual or emotional excitement the features of
plain people assume an aspect of exquisite beauty. Love transfuses
a homely girl’s countenance with a glow of angelic loveliness;
and biographies are full of statements concerning the countenances
of men of genius, which, ordinarily unattractive, assumed an expression
of unearthly beauty while their minds were active and
electrified the facial muscles.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is not any virtue the exercise of which, even momentarily,
will not impress a new fairness upon the features,” says Mr.
Ruskin; and again, he speaks of “the operation of the intellectual
powers upon the features, in the fine cutting and chiselling of
them, and removal from them of signs of sensuality and sloth, by
which they are blunted and deadened, and substitution of energy
and intensity for vacancy and insipidity (by which wants alone the
faces of many fair women are utterly spoiled and rendered valueless);
and by the keenness given to the eye and fine moulding and
development to the brow, of which effects Sir Charles Bell has well
noted the desirableness and opposition to brutal types.”</p>

<p class='c001'>An English clergyman, the Rev. F. P. Lawson, diocesan inspector
for Northamptonshire, issued a report not long ago concerning the
results of his observations in 325 urban and rural schools during
several years, regarding the effects of good education in improving
the appearance of the children. “A school, thoroughly well
taught, seldom failed to exhibit a considerable number of interesting
little faces, and a striking absence of such faces might invariably
be associated with poverty of tone and superficial instruction.
Nothing struck him more forcibly in a school that has been
suddenly lifted out of the mire by a firstrate teacher than the
bright and thoughtful look which the children soon acquire.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Negative evidence to the same effect might also be cited by the
volume, but one case may suffice. “It is unhappily a fact,” says
Mr. Galton, “that fairly distinct types of criminals <em>breeding true
to their kind</em> have become established, and are one of the saddest
disfigurements of modern civilisation.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>The connection between culture and a superior type of Beauty
is strikingly revealed in the following remarks on the far-famed
Georgian women of the Caucasus, made by a great connoisseur of
feminine beauty, the poet Bodenstedt: "In Europe the notion
prevails that a Georgian woman is a tall, graceful being, of luscious
form, clothed in wide, rich garments, with dense black hair, long
enough to enchain all masculine hearts, an open, noble forehead,
and a pair of eyes which contain within their dark, mysterious,
magic circle all the secrets of human delight that come through
the soul or the senses. Her gait is rapture. Joy precedes, and
admiration follows her.... With such notions in their heads,
strangers generally arrive in Georgia, and find themselves wofully
disappointed. The tourists who come with such great expectations
to visit this country, invested with the atmosphere of a fairyland
by history and legend, either adhere stubbornly to their preconceived
notions, or else they instantly go over to the opposite
extreme, and find everything dirty, ugly, disgusting, dreadful.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The truth lies between these extremes. The Georgians are,
all in all, one of the handsomest nations on the earth. But
although I am a great admirer of women, I am compelled in this
case to award the prize to the men instead of the women. This
opinion is endorsed by all educated inhabitants of Georgia who
have eyes, taste, and an impartial judgment.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I must add that of that higher beauty where heart and
intellect and soul are mirrored in the eye, I found few traces in
the whole Caucasus, either among men or women. I have seen
the greater number of the beauties which Georgia boasts, but not
one face have I seen that satisfied me completely, though the
picturesque native costume does much to heighten the charms of
the women. The face entirely lacks that refined mental expression
which makes a beautiful European woman such a unique enchantress.
Such a woman may still inspire love and win hearts long
after the time of her bloom; whereas in a Georgian <em>everything</em>
fades with youth. The eyes, which, notwithstanding their apparent
fire, never expressed anything but calm and voluptuous indolence,
lose their lustre; the nose, which even in its normal relations
exceeds the limits of beauty, assumes, in consequence of the
premature hollowness of the cheeks, such abnormal dimensions
that many people imagine that it actually continues to grow; and
the bosom, which the national costume makes no effort to conceal,
prematurely loses its natural firmness—all of which phenomena
are observed in European women much less frequently, and in a
less exaggerated form. If you add to this the habit, so prevalent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>among Georgians, young and old, of using white and red cosmetics,
you will understand that such rude and inartistic arts of the toilet
can only add to the observer’s sense of dissatisfaction.”</p>

<p class='c001'>America affords many illustrations of the manner in which
refinement of mind and manners increases Beauty in a single
generation. There are in every city thousands of parents who
began life as ordinary labourers, but soon got rich through industry
or good luck. They bring up their children in houses where every
attention is paid to sanitary rules; they send them to school and
college; and when they come back you would hardly believe that
those coarse-featured, clumsy-limbed, ungraceful persons could be
their father and mother. The discrepancy is sometimes so great
that when the young folks invite people of “their set” to their
house, the old birds keep out of the way discreetly, either of their
own accord or by filial dictation, which in America appears to be
displacing parental authority.</p>

<p class='c001'>But if there is such an intimate connection between culture and
Beauty, how is it that we so often find plain features joined with
a noble mind and fine features with a mean mind? Mr. Spencer
has endeavoured to explain this apparent discrepancy by assuming
that in such cases plain features are inherited severally and separately
from ancestors of diverse physiognomies, which being merely
mechanically mixed, not fused, fail to harmonise. There may be
something in this, but a simpler explanation is at hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>Noble minds are often the result of individual effort, and
persistence in it. Many men of genius have had humble parents
not specially gifted. From these parents and their ancestors they
inherited their plain faces. Now individual effort, in the short
period of a lifetime, is insufficient to alter the <em>proportions</em> of a
face, which depend on its bony parts; but it does suffice to alter
the <em>expression</em>, which depends on the movements of the soft,
muscular parts. Hence every person, however plain-featured,
may acquire a beautiful expression by cultivating his mind and
refining his manners and temper. Whenever, therefore, we meet
a man or woman whose features are less attractive at rest than
when moved to expression of emotion, we may feel sure that they
owe their mental refinement more to individual effort than to
inherited capacity.</p>

<p class='c001'>The children of such persons will be more beautiful than they
are themselves, because they will inherit the parents’ habit of
expressive muscular action of the features. And owing to the
fact that all the bony parts of the body are modified in accordance
with the action of the muscles attached to them, the bony parts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>the proportions, of the face will also be gradually modified and
moulded into nobler shapes, through the continuance of refined
emotional expression.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is in this manner that intellectual growth and emotional
refinement have gradually differentiated our features from those of
our savage ancestors. Our lips have become more delicate, our
mouths smaller, our jaws less gigantic, ponderous, and projecting,
because civilisation has taught us to use the hands in preparing
food, and to cut it instead of tearing it off the bone with the
teeth, as savages and other wild animals do.</p>

<p class='c001'>Use increases, disuse diminishes the size of an organ. Hence
for the same reason that our jaws have become less projecting and
heavy, our forehead has lost its backward slope and become
straight and noble, owing to the growth of the brain. And
similarly with other peculiarities of the face, indicating the connection
between mental refinement and physical beauty. “Thus
is it,” says Mr. Spencer, “with depression of the bridge of the
nose, which is a characteristic both of barbarians and of our
babes, possessed by them in common with our higher quadrumana.
Thus, also, is it with that forward opening of the nostrils, which
renders them conspicuous in a front view of the face,—a trait
alike of infants, savages, and apes. And the same may be said
of widespread alæ to the nose, of great width between the eyes, of
long mouth, of large mouth—indeed of all those leading peculiarities
of feature which are by general consent called ugly.”</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>EVOLUTION OF TASTE</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>SAVAGE NOTIONS OF BEAUTY</h3>

<p class='c013'>In all the preceding remarks concerning the connection between
mental and physical beauty, the assumption has been made tacitly
that what <em>we</em> consider beautiful is so in reality; and that our
taste is a safe guide to follow. Yet this assumption may be
challenged, and has, indeed, been often challenged. Every nation,
every savage tribe, has its own standard of Beauty; what right,
therefore, have <em>we</em> to claim dogmatically that we are infallible
judges?</p>

<p class='c001'>Ask the devil, says Voltaire, what is the meaning of το
καλὸν—the Beautiful—and he will tell you <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Le beau est une
paire de comes, quatre griffes, et une queue”</span>—a couple of horns,
four claws, and a tail. Ask a North American Indian, says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>Hearne, what is Beauty, he will answer: “A broad, flat face,
small eyes, high cheek-bones, three or four broad black lines
across each cheek, a low forehead, a large, broad chin, a clumsy
hook-nose, a tawny hide, and breasts hanging down to the belt.”
In the Chinese empire “those women are preferred who have ...
a broad face, high cheek-bones, very broad noses, and enormous
ears.” “One of the titles of the Zulu king,” says Darwin (who
gives many other instances <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>à propos</i></span> in chapter xix. of the <cite>Descent of
Man</cite>), “is ‘You who are black.’ Mr. Galton, in speaking to me
about the natives of South Africa, remarked that their ideas of
beauty seem very different from ours; for in one tribe two slim,
slight, and pretty girls were not admired by the natives.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Darwin himself appears to have been staggered and puzzled by
this diversity of taste, and to have partly inclined to the theory
that Beauty is relative to the human mind (though elsewhere he
repudiates it)—a theory which Jeffrey has so boldly formulated in
the assertion that “All tastes are equally just and true, in as far
as concerns the individual whose taste is in question; and what a
man feels distinctly to be beautiful <em>is beautiful</em> to him, whatever
other people may think of it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Fiddlesticks! The Alison-Jeffrey school of Scotch æstheticians,
having been among the first in the field, have done more to
confuse the English mind on the subject of Beauty than several
generations of other clever writers will be able to clear up again.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are about half a dozen sound, square, solid, scientific
reasons why we have a better right to our opinion concerning the
nature of Beauty than a Hottentot or a North American Indian.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>NON-ÆSTHETIC ORNAMENTATION</h3>

<p class='c013'>One of the things most commonly forgotten by those who
wonder at the strange “taste” of savages is that many of their
customs have nothing whatever to do with the sense of beauty.
The habit of putting on “war-paint” originated not in a desire
for ornamentation, but in the wish to make themselves frightful
in appearance to the enemy. For the same reason heads are
mutilated. As Waitz notes in speaking of Tahiti: “A very ugly
mutilation is that to which most of the boys had to subject themselves.
Immediately after birth their mothers compressed their
forehead and the back of the head, so that the former became
narrow and high, the latter flat; this was done to make their
aspect more terrible, and thus turn them into more formidable
warriors.” Tattooing, likewise, was originally intended to be an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>easy sign of recognition, or of social or religious distinction, rather
than an ornament of the body. And when we consider how prone
the mind of our own fashionable ladies is to violate every canon
of good taste in their wild effort to surpass one another in some
novel extravagance just from Paris; when we note that if a Fifth
Avenue lady wears a gull on her hat, her coloured cook will invest
in a turkey or ostrich for hers, we understand at once that many
of the mutilations approved by savages are the outcome of vanity
and emulation, not of æsthetic taste.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>PERSONAL BEAUTY AS A FINE ART</h3>

<p class='c013'>Yet there are undoubtedly a number of physiognomic and other
peculiarities which savages admire while we consider them ugly;
and some, again, which we admire and they dislike. Have we a
right to consider them inferior to us in taste because they fail to
admire what we adore?</p>

<p class='c001'>Certainly; beyond the shadow of a doubt. It takes genius to
fully appreciate genius; it takes a refined taste to appreciate
refined beauty. This is what the savage lacks.</p>

<p class='c001'>Look at any one of the fine arts. Why does the savage prefer
his monotonous drumming and ear-piercing war-songs to a soft,
beautiful, dreamy Chopin nocturne? Because he <em>cannot understand</em>
the nocturne.</p>

<p class='c001'>Why does he prefer his painted, clumsy, coarse-featured squaw
to a civilised woman with delicate contours, refined features,
graceful gait? Because he <em>does not understand</em> the beauty of the
latter. It is too subtle for his coarse nerves, his feeble imagination.
The smiles and manifold expressions that chase one another
across her lovely features, like the subtly-interwoven melodies in
a symphonic poem, are the visible signs of thoughts and emotions
which he has never experienced, and therefore cannot understand.
It is like giving him a page of Sanskrit to read.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is for this reason that a negro never falls in love with a
white woman, and that a peasant prefers his plump, crude
country-girl to the fair, delicate city visitor. He requires more
vigorous arms, broader features, than the city girl possesses, to
make an impression on his callous nerves of touch and sight.
And it is fortunate for the peasant girl that her lover does lack
taste, else she would soon find him a fickle deserter.</p>

<p class='c001'>The savage, in a word, prefers his style of “beauty” to ours for
the same reason that he prefers a piece of raw liver and a glass of
oil to the subtle flavours of French cookery and French wines.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>His senses are too coarse, his mind too vulgar, to perceive
the poetry of refined features. Everything must be loud and
exaggerated to make an impression on him—loud music, loud
and glaring red and yellow colours, loud and coarse features.</p>

<p class='c001'>This doctrine that differences of taste are merely due to differences
in the degree of æsthetic culture, and that there is such a
thing as an absolute standard of human beauty, derives further
support from the facts (1) that the ideal of beauty set up by the
æsthetic Greeks two thousand years ago corresponds so remarkably
with that of modern artistic minds; (2) that <i>e.g.</i> a Japanese
student in the United States soon learns to prefer American female
beauty to the Japanese variety; (3) that an English, Italian, or
American audience who at first admire <cite>Norma</cite> and find <cite>Lohengrin</cite>
tiresome, can in a few seasons be so educated as to prefer
<cite>Lohengrin</cite> and actually scorn <cite>Norma</cite>; but not <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versâ</i></span>, in either
case (2) or (3).</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Ruskin takes a similar view regarding differences of taste
when he says that “respecting what has been asserted of negro
nations looking with disgust on the white face, no importance whatever
is to be attached to the opinions of races who have never
received any ideas of beauty whatsoever (these ideas being only
received by minds under some certain degree of cultivation), and
whose disgust arises naturally from what they suppose to be a sign
of weakness or ill-health.”</p>

<p class='c001'>That this consideration of health does affect the negro’s judgment
regarding the beauty of the white complexion, is also shown
by what Mr. Winwood Reade told Mr. Darwin, namely, that the
negro’s “horror of whiteness may be attributed ... partly to the
belief held by most negroes that demons and spirits are white, and
partly to their thinking it a sign of ill-health.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But of all the theoretical truths emphasised in the <cite>Modern
Painters</cite> none is so important as this: “That not only changes of
opinion take place in consequence of experience, but that those
changes are from <em>variation</em> of opinion to <em>unity</em> of opinion,—that
whatever may be the difference of estimate among unpractised or
uncultivated tastes, there will be unity of taste among the
experienced; and that, therefore, the result of repeated trial and
experience is to arrive at principles of preference in some sort common
to all, and which are part of our nature.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us now see what are those principles of Beauty that may
be considered independent of a more or less crude and undeveloped
taste. Some are negative, some positive.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>NEGATIVE TESTS OF BEAUTY</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>(<i>a</i>) <em>Animals.</em>—"It has been argued," says Darwin (by Schaffhausen),
“that ugliness consists in an approach to the structure of
the lower animals, and no doubt this is partly true with the more
civilised nations, in which intellect is highly appreciated; but
this explanation will hardly apply to all forms of ugliness.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Curiously enough, savages themselves use animals as a negative
test of beauty. Thus we read that “the Indians of Paraguay
eradicate their eyebrows and eyelashes, saying that they do not
wish to be like horses.” “On the Eastern coast, the negro boys,
when they saw Burton, cried out, ‘Look at the white man; does
he not look like a white ape?’” “A man of Cochin China ‘spoke
with contempt of the wife of the English ambassador—that she
had white teeth like a dog, and a rosy colour like that of potato-flowers.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>A few centuries ago it was a favourite pastime of physiognomists
to draw elaborate parallels between men and animals. Thus, in
1593, there appeared a work, <cite>De Humana Physiognomia</cite>, with
numerous illustrations, in which always a human face was matched
with some animal’s head. Professor Wundt thus sums up the
essence of this book: “A broad forehead, we are told, indicates
fearfulness, because the ox with his broad head lacks courage. A
long forehead, on the other hand, indicates erudition, as is shown
by means of an intelligent dog who has the honour of serving as a
pendant to Plato’s profile. Persons with shaggy hair are good-natured,
as they resemble the lion. He whose eyebrows are
turned inwards, towards the nose, is uncleanly like the pig, which
this resembles. The narrow chin of the ape signifies malice and
envy. Long ears and thick lips, such as the donkey possesses, are
signs of stupidity. A person who has a nose crooked from the
forehead inclines, like the raven, to theft, etc. These animal-physiognomists
appear to have favoured a thoroughly pessimistic
view of man’s capacities, inasmuch as for every creditable resemblance
they find at least ten discreditable ones.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Apart from these puerilities, it is in most cases simply absurd
to compare man with animals. Except in the case of apes there
are no proper terms of comparison, because the types are so distinct;
and, moreover, from the point of view of its own type, the average
animal of any species is more beautiful than the average man or
woman from the human point of view. This assertion is indirectly
corroborated by Mr. Galton’s testimony, that “our human civilised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>stock is far more weakly through congenital imperfection than that
of any other species of animals, whether wild or domestic.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Schopenhauer considered animals beautiful in every way, and
suggested that whenever we do find an animal ugly it is due to
some irrelevant, inevitable association of ideas, as when a monkey
suggests a man, or a toad mud. And Mr. Ruskin pertinently
suggests that “That mind only is fully disciplined in its theoretic
power which, when it chooses, throwing off the sympathies and
repugnancies with which the ideas of destructiveness or of innocence
accustom us to regard the animal tribes, as well as those
meaner likes and dislikes which arise, I think, from the greater or
less resemblance of animal powers to our own, can pursue the
pleasures of typical beauty down to the scales of the alligator, the
coils of the serpent, and the joints of the beetle.”</p>

<p class='c001'>When Sir Charles Bell intimated that in Greek sculpture the
guiding principle was remoteness from the animal type, he stated
only one side of the truth, of which the other is thus noted by
Winckelmann: among the Greeks, he says, “The study of artists
in producing ideal beauties was directed to the nature of the nobler
beasts, so that they not only instituted comparisons between the
forms of the human countenance and the shape of the head of
certain animals, but they even undertook to adopt from animals
the means of imparting greater majesty and elevation to their
statues ... especially in the heads of Hercules.” Jupiter’s head
“has the complete aspect of the lion, the king of beasts, not only
in the large, round eyes, in the fulness of the prominent, and, as it
were, swollen forehead, and in the nose, but also in the hair, which
hangs from his head like the mane of the lion, first rising upward
from the forehead, and then, parting on each side into a bow, again
falling downward.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So that we may safely reject the theory that ugliness consists
in an approach to the structure of the lower animals, whatever
savages and Chinamen may think on this subject. Coarse minds
little suspect what exquisite beauty is to be found in the head of a
cow or a donkey, a puppy or a lamb—beauty which, like a lovely
melody, may bring tears to the eyes of one who is sensitive to
æsthetic impressions. Objectively considered, even the destructive
emotions do not appear ugly in an animal. The ferocity of a lion
does not make him appear vicious, because ferocity is his nature.
He knows no better; can only live by fighting. But a man is
disfigured by ferocity because he does know better; he <em>can</em> live
without fighting; and it is <em>the consciousness of his selfish meanness</em>
that puts the stamp of ugliness on his distorted features.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>In apes alone does fierceness seem ugly and brutal instead of
sublime. For apes bear so much resemblance to us, and have a
brain so superior in structure to that of other animals, that we feel
justified in applying the human standard. Hence apes alone afford
us a negative test of beauty. Their heads and faces are cast in
our mould, and therefore afford the means of direct comparison.
In looking at their massive, brutal jaws, their receding foreheads,
their undifferentiated hands and feet, their coarse, hairy skin, their
clumsy, inexpressive, gigantic mouths, their flat noses and nostrils
open to the view, we are justified in calling them ugly, compared
with ourselves, and in feeling proud that civilisation has gradually
raised us so far above our country cousins, in beauty as in everything
else, except the art of climbing trees.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>b</i>) <em>Savages</em> are valuable as negative tests of beauty for the
same reason: they enable us to see what progress we have made
in refining our features into harmonious proportions, and making
them susceptible of diverse emotional expression. It should be
noted that Nature constantly endeavours to make primitive mankind
beautiful, as it does with all other animals. Tourists constantly
note the occurrence of remarkable instances of Personal
Beauty among the young in most tribes. But this natural Beauty
is not appreciated by the vulgar taste of savages, as we saw a few
pages back in a case mentioned by Mr. Galton. Beauty must be
distorted and exaggerated before it pleases the savage’s taste.
Paint must be laid on an inch thick, the nose perforated and
“adorned” with a ring, and ditto the abnormally lengthened lips.
This corrects the notion that savage hideousness is a product of
Nature. Nature may blunder, but never so sadly as in the appearance
of a savage belle or warrior; and in scorning these we do not
therefore scorn Nature, but merely the artificial products of the
vulgar taste of primitive man.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>c</i>) <em>Degraded Classes.</em>—Poverty, suffering, want of leisure for
mental culture, want of money for sanitary modes of living, have,
unfortunately, produced in all countries a large class in whom
Personal Beauty occurs only as an accident. That such unhappy
mortals afford a negative test of Beauty is seen by the fact that,
just as savages are intermediate between monkeys and them, so
they stand between savages and refined men in features and expression.</p>

<p class='c001'>Poverty alone does not produce this vulgar type of personal
appearance; it is intellectual indolence, moral vice, and hygienic
indifference that are responsible for it. Hence this third negative
teat of Beauty is not at all difficult to find in any sphere of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>society, from the hod-carrier to the aristocrat with a pedigree of a
hundred generations. In every scale of the social ladder may be
found “features seamed by sickness, dimmed by sensuality, convulsed
by passion, pinched by poverty, shadowed by sorrow,
branded with remorse; bodies consumed with sloth, broken down
by labour, tortured by disease, dishonoured in foul uses; intellects
without power, hearts without hope, minds earthly and devilish”
(Ruskin).</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>d</i>) <em>Age and Decrepitude.</em>—It is not true, as a famous
Frenchwoman has remarked, that age and beauty are incompatible
terms. Even age and Love are not incompatible, as we saw in
the chapter on Genius in Love; and Byron has remarked that
Love, like the measles, is most dangerous when it comes late in
life.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a special variety of Beauty for every period of life,
and the Beauty of old age certainly is not the least attractive of
these varieties. What could be more majestic, more admirable,
than the head of a Longfellow in his last days? Provided health
of mind and body has been maintained, even the folds in the
cheeks, the wrinkles on the forehead of old age, are not unbeautiful.
But when senility means decrepitude, brought on by a
neglectful or otherwise vicious life, then it is positively ugly. The
loveliest thing in the world is a fair and amiable maiden; the
ugliest a vicious old hag—savages and apes <em>not</em> excepted.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>e</i>) <em>Disease.</em>—Temperance preachers and other hygienic reformers
commonly dwell too exclusively on the dangers to health,
domestic peace, moral progress, and refinement which the indulgence
in various vices entails. If they would insist with equal,
or even greater, emphasis on the havoc which diseases brought on
by intemperance and neglect of the laws of Health make on
Personal Beauty, they would double their influence on their audiences
or readers. For in woman’s heart the desire to be beautiful
is and always will be the strongest motive to action or nonaction;
nor are men, as a rule, much less interested in the matter
of preserving a handsome appearance. It may make <em>some</em> impression
on a man to tell him that if he takes ice-water before
breakfast, or “cock-tails” at various odd hours on an empty
stomach, he will ruin his digestion; but the impression will be six
times as deep if you can convince him that he will ere long look
like that confirmed dyspeptic Jones, with lack-lustre eyes, sallow
complexion, and a general expression of premature senility, which
accounts for the fact that he has been twice already refused by the
girl he adores.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>Or take that girl over there who never takes a walk, always
sleeps with her windows hermetically closed, and never allows a
ray of sunshine to touch any part of her body. Tell her she is
ruining her health and she may be momentarily alarmed by this
vague warning, and walk half a mile for a week or so, until she
has forgotten it. But make it clear to her what is the exact consequence
of such neglect of the primal laws of health—namely,
the premature loss of every trace of Personal Beauty and youthful
charm, with old-maidenhood inevitably staring her in the face,
owing to her apathetic appearance and gait, her sickly complexion,
her features distorted by frequent headaches, brought on by lack
of fresh, cool air—each of which leaves its permanent trace in
the form of an addition to a wrinkle or subtraction from the
plumpness of her cheeks,—tell her all this, and that her eyes
will soon sink into their sockets and have blue rings like
those of an invalid, and a ghastly stare—and she will, perhaps,
be sufficiently roused to save her Health for the sake of her
Beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'>We are now confronted with the question, Why is it that disease
is a mark of ugliness, health a mark of Beauty? The old
Scotch school of æstheticians think it is all a matter of association.
We consider certain forms characteristic of health as
beautiful simply because we associate with them various emotions
of affection, the pleasures of love, etc., and conversely with
disease and vice. According to Stendhal, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“La beauté n’est que
la promesse du bonheur,”</span> or, in American, Beauty is simply the
promise of a “good time.” But it is Lord Jeffrey who, to use
another appropriate American expression, “goes the whole hog”
in this matter, by practically denying the existence of such a
thing as a pure, disinterested, æsthetic sense. Suppose, he says,
"that the smooth forehead, the firm cheek, and the full lip, which
are now so distinctly expressive to us of the gay and vigorous
periods of youth—and the clear and blooming complexion, which
indicates health and activity—had been, in fact, the forms and
colours by which old age and sickness were characterised; and
that, instead of being found united to those sources and seasons of
enjoyment, they had been the badges by which Nature pointed
out that state of suffering and decay which is now signified to us
by the livid and emaciated face of sickness, or the wrinkled front,
the quivering lip, and hollow cheek of age; if this were the
familiar law of our nature, can it be doubted that we should look
upon these appearances, not with rapture, but with aversion, and
consider it as absolutely ludicrous or disgusting to speak of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>beauty of what was interpreted by every one as the lamented sign
of pain and decrepitude?</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mr. Knight himself, though a firm believer in the intrinsic
beauty of colours, is so much of this opinion that he thinks it
entirely owing to those associations that we prefer the tame
smoothness and comparatively poor colours of a youthful face
to the richly fretted and variegated countenance of a pimpled
drunkard.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bosh! and a hundred times bosh! One feels that these men
lived at a time when port was drunk by the bottle, like claret,
and when variegated noses were to a certain extent fashionable.</p>

<p class='c001'>Though every reader feels the sophistry and absurdity of the
above argumentation, it is not easy to refute it. Professor Blackie
declaims against it, Ruskin sneers at it, but nowhere have I been
able to find a definite direct refutation of the thesis. The following
suggestions may, therefore, be of some value.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first place, Jeffrey’s supposition is equivalent to saying
that if black were white, white would be black. For if all the
phenomena of human nature were reversed, our taste, being also
a “phenomenon,” would be reversed too. If health meant emaciation,
then a lover would not be happy unless he could kiss a
pair of leathery lips and embrace a skeleton. Hence his sense of
touch, like his sight, would have to be the reverse of what they
are now; and that being the case, æsthetic taste, which is based
on the senses, would of course be reversed too. But that is
simply saying that if you stand a man on his head his feet will be
in the air.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, Lord Jeffrey’s argument involves the old fallacy that
the useful and the beautiful are identical—that we only consider
those things beautiful which afford us some utilitarian gratification.
If this theory were correct, a coal-boat would be more beautiful
than a yacht; a savage’s big jaw-bone more beautiful than our
delicate ones; a clumsy, dirty, coarse-featured labourer more
beautiful than a society belle.</p>

<p class='c001'>No; we have, thank heaven, an æsthetic sense which enables
us to see and admire beauty quite independently of any “associations”
which it may have with our utilitarian cravings. It is
possible, however, and even probable, that the æsthetic sense was
originally <em>developed</em> from utilitarian associations. On this subject
Mr. Grant Allen has some exceedingly valuable remarks in his
interesting work on the Colour-Sense. He there eloquently sets
forth the view that it was the bright tints of luscious fruits that
first taught primitive man to derive pleasure from the sight of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>coloured objects. This gradually led to a “predilection for brilliant
dyes and glistening pebbles; till at last the whole series
culminates in that intense and unselfish enjoyment of rich and
pure tints which make civilised man linger so lovingly over the
hues of sunset and the myriad shades of autumn.... The <em>disinterested</em>
affection can only be reached by many previous steps of
utilitarian progress.” But—and here lies the kernel of the argument—"fruit-eaters
and flower-feeders derive pleasure from brilliant
colours ... not because those colours have mental associations
with their food, but because the structures which perceive
them have been continually exercised and strengthened by hereditary
use," until at last they formed a special nervous or cerebral
apparatus which presides over impressions of beauty, and takes a
special pleasure in its own activity, apart from all utilitarian
considerations.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lord Jeffrey apparently lacked this special æsthetic sense, as
shown by his whole argument, and by his inability, which he
shared with Alison, of finding beauty in Nature, unless it was in
some way associated with man’s presence and man’s mean utilities.</p>

<p class='c001'>How different this from the feelings of the man who of all
writers on Beauty has the most highly developed æsthetic sense—Mr.
Ruskin, who has just told us in his <cite>Autobiography</cite> that his
love of Nature, ardent as it is, depends entirely on the <em>wildness</em>
of the scenery, its remoteness from human influences and associations.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is this specially-developed æsthetic taste that would prevent
man from calling flabby cheeks, sallow complexions, pimpled noses,
and sunken eyes beautiful, if by some miracle they should be
changed into signs of health. For this sense of beauty was first
educated not by the sight of human beauty, but of beauty in
Nature—fruits, pebbles, shells, lustrous metals, etc.; and the
notions of beauty thus obtained have been gradually transferred
to human beings as standards of attractiveness. It can be shown
that what the best judges pronounce the highest human beauty,
is so because it partakes of certain characteristics which we find
beautiful throughout Nature. And conversely, what we consider
ugly in the human form and features would also be called ugly in
external objects; in both cases, be it distinctly understood, without
any direct reference to utilitarian considerations, and sometimes
even in opposition to them, as in our admiration of a
beautiful poisonous plant or snake, or a tiger.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is these universal characteristics of Beauty, found in man as
in animals, that we now have to consider. They are the <em>positive</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>criteria of Beauty, and may be regarded as a new set of “overtones”
or leading motives for the remainder of this volume,
although the old ones will occasionally reappear and combine with
them.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>POSITIVE TESTS OF BEAUTY</h3>

<p class='c013'>Of these there are at least eight—Symmetry, Curvature,
Gradation, Smoothness, Delicacy, Colour, Lustre, Expression,
including Variety and Individuality.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>a</i>) <em>Symmetry.</em>—"In all perfectly beautiful objects," says Mr.
Ruskin, “there is found the opposition of one part to another,
and a reciprocal balance obtained; in animals the balance being
commonly between opposite sides (note the disagreeableness occasioned
by the exception in flat fish, having the eyes on one side of
the head); but in vegetables the opposition is less distinct, as in
the boughs on opposite sides of trees, and the leaves and sprays
on each side of the boughs, and in dead matter less perfect still,
often amounting only to a certain tendency towards a balance, as in
the opposite sides of valleys and alternate windings of streams.
In things in which perfect symmetry is, from their nature, impossible
or improper, a balance must be at least in some measure
expressed before they can be beheld with pleasure.... Symmetry
is the <em>opposition</em> of <em>equal</em> quantities to each other. Proportion
the <em>connection</em> of <em>unequal</em> quantities with each other. The property
of a tree in sending out equal boughs on opposite sides is
symmetrical. Its sending out shorter and smaller towards the
top, proportional. In the human face its balance of opposite sides
is symmetry, its division upwards, proportion.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Darwin thus gives his testimony as to the prevalence of
symmetry in Nature: “If beautiful objects had been created
solely for man’s gratification, it ought to be shown that before
man appeared there was less beauty on the face of the earth than
since he came on the stage. Were the beautiful volute and cone
shells of the Eocene epoch, and the gracefully sculptured ammonites
of the Secondary period, created that man might ages afterwards
admire them in his cabinet? Few objects are more beautiful
than the minute silicious cases of the diatomaceæ: were they
created that they might be examined and admired under the
higher powers of the microscope? The beauty in this latter case,
and in many others, is apparently wholly due to symmetry of
growth” (<cite>Origin of Species</cite>, chap. vi.)</p>

<p class='c001'>In the floral world, again, the natural tendency is always
towards symmetry. Wind-fertilised flowers are symmetrical in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>form; and “as Mr. Darwin has observed, there does not appeal
to be a single instance of an irregular flower which is not fertilised
by insects or birds” (Lubbock), and therefore modified in form in
the effort to adapt itself to useful insects and to exclude pirates.</p>

<p class='c001'>Throughout the animal kingdom, including man, this law of
symmetry is true. Hence it is not likely that we should ever
admire a lame leg, a crooked nose, bent on one side, eyes that are
not mates, or a face several inches longer on one side than the
other, owing to paralysis—as <em>beautiful</em>, even if, as Jeffrey would
have it, Madame Nature should suddenly take it into her head to
associate such abnormalities with health instead of with disease.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>b</i>) <cite>Gradation.</cite>—On this law of Nature Mr. Ruskin again has
spoken at once more scientifically and poetically than any other
writer on æsthetics: "What curvature is to lines, gradation is to
shades and colours.... For instances of the complete <em>absence</em> of
gradation we must look to man’s work, or to his <em>disease</em> and
<em>decrepitude</em>. Compare the gradated colours of the rainbow with
the stripes of a target, and the gradual concentration of the youthful
blood in the cheek with an abrupt patch of rouge, or with the
sharply-drawn veining of old age.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Gradation is so inseparable a quality of all natural shade and
colour that the eye refuses in art to understand anything as either
which appears without it; while, on the other hand, nearly all
the gradations of nature are so subtile, and between degrees of
tint so slightly separated, that no human hand can in any wise
equal, or do anything more than suggest the idea of them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The following remarks which the same writer makes in another
place concerning Gradation show at the same time how asinine it
is for a savage or any other person of uncultivated taste to set
himself up as a judge of Personal Beauty, as good as any one else,
on the plea that it is all “a matter of taste” and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de gustibus non
est disputandum</i></span>:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“When the eye is quite uncultivated, it sees that a man is a
man, and a face is a face, but has no idea what shadows or lights
fall upon the form or features. Cultivate it to some degree of
artistic power, and it will then see shadows distinctly, but only
the more vigorous of them. Cultivate it still further, and it will
see light within light, and shadow within shadow, and will continually
refuse to rest in what it has already discovered, that it
may pursue what is more removed and more subtle, until at last
it comes to give its chief attention and display its chief power on
<em>gradations which to an untrained faculty are partly matters of
indifference and partly imperceptible</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>The words italicised enable us to appreciate what Sokrates
must have had in his mind when he distinguished between that
which <em>is</em> beautiful and that which only <em>appears</em> beautiful.
Æsthetic training enables us to see things as they are, instead of
as they appear through inattention, through ignorance, or through
clouds of national prejudice, or individual utilitarianism.</p>

<p class='c001'>The way in which æsthetic training enables us to see gradations
of beauty previously imperceptible can be most strikingly illustrated
in the case of music. There are thousands of intelligent
folks who cannot tell the difference between a superb Steinway
Grand, just timed for a concert, and a harsh, clangy, mountain-hotel
piano that has not been tuned for two years. But give
these persons a thorough musical education, and they will soon be
able to smile at Jeffrey’s notion that the tone of the hotel-piano
was quite as beautiful as that of the Steinway, because it <em>seemed</em>
so to them. It is not only the imagination but the senses themselves
that require training. A Hottentot or any unmusical
person cannot tell the difference between two consecutive tones on
the piano, whereas a skilled musician can detect all the gradations
from one tone to another, down to the sixty-fourth part of a
semitone!</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is all a matter of taste!” Precisely. Of good taste and
bad taste.</p>

<p class='c001'>Examples of gradation in the human form are the gradual
tapering of the limbs and the fingers, the exquisite line from the
female neck to the shoulders and the bosom, the blushes on the
cheeks, so long as they do not assume the form of a hectic flush,
and the delicate tints of the complexion in general, varying with
emotional states, according as the veins and arteries are more or
less filled with the vital fluid.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is it then “entirely owing to their associations” with health
or disease that we prefer the complexion of a youthful face to the
hideous daubs of red which Knight refers to as the “richly fretted
and variegated countenance of a pimpled drunkard”? Is it owing
to such associations that we prefer the delicately gradated blushes
of coloured marble to the richly bedaubed countenance of a pimpled
brickbat? But it would be a waste of time to refer again to the
crude anti-æsthetic notions of Messrs. Knight, Alison, and Jeffrey.</p>

<p class='c001'>One more exquisite illustration of subtle gradation in the
human form divine may be cited from Winckelmann:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“The soul, though a simple existence, brings forth at once,
and in an instant, many different ideas; so it is with the beautiful
youthful outline, which appears simple, and yet at the same time has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>infinitely different variations, and that soft tapering which is
difficult of attainment in a column, is still more so in the diverse
forms of the youthful body. Among the innumerable kinds of
columns in Rome some appear pre-eminently elegant on account
of this very tapering; of these I have particularly noted two of
granite, which I am always studying anew: just so rare is a
perfect form, even in the most beautiful youth, which has a
stationary point in our sex still less than in the female.”</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>c</i>) <em>Curvature.</em>—"That all forms of acknowledged beauty are
composed exclusively of curves will," Mr. Ruskin believes, “be at
once allowed; but that which there will be need more especially
to prove, is the subtility and constancy of curvature in all natural
forms whatsoever. I believe that, except in crystals, in certain
mountain forms admitted for the sake of sublimity or contrast (as
in the slope of debris), in rays of light, in the levels of calm water
and alluvial land, and in some few organic developments, there are
no lines or surfaces of nature without curvature, though, as we
before saw in clouds, more especially in their under lines towards
the horizon, and in vast and extended plains, right lines are often
suggested which are not actual. Without these we should not be
sensible of the value of contrasting curves; and while, therefore,
for the most part, the eye is fed in natural forms with a grace of
curvature which no hand nor instrument can follow, other means
are provided to give beauty to those surfaces which are admitted
for contrast, <em>as in water by its reflection of the gradations which
it possesses not itself</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In a footnote to the last edition of the <cite>Modern Painters</cite> he
adds regarding the apparent exceptions named: “Crystals are
indeed subject to rectilinear limitations, but their real surfaces are
continually curved; the level of calm water is only right lined
when it is shoreless.”</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, “Generally in all ruin and disease, and
interference of one order of being with another (as in the cattle
line of park trees), the curves vanish, and violently opposed or
broken and unmeaning lines take their place.” I feel tempted to
cite another most admirable passage on curvature throughout
Nature—even where it is least looked for, and the untrained eye
cannot see it—in the shattered walls and crests of mountains
which “seem to rise in a gloomy contrast with the soft waves of
bank and wood beneath.” But it is too long to quote, and I can
only advise the reader most earnestly to look it up in chapter
xiv. vol. iv.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Straight lines,” Professor Bain observes, “are rendered artistic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>only by associations of power, regularity, fitness, etc.” “In some
situations straight lines are æsthetic.... In the human figure
there underlies the curved outline a certain element of rigidity
and straightness, indicating strength in the supporting limbs and
spine. Whenever firmness is required, there must be a solid
structure, and straightness of form is a frequent accompaniment
of solidity. The straight nose and the flat brow are subsidiary to
the movement and the stability of the face.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet even our straight limbs follow in their motions the law
of curvature. And to this fact that they move more easily and
naturally in a curved than in a straight line, which requires
laborious adjustment, Bain traces part of our superior pleasure in
rounded lines.</p>

<p class='c001'>What infinite subtlety and variety Curvature is capable of is
vividly brought before the eyes by Winckelmann: “The forms of
a beautiful body are determined by lines the centre of which is
constantly changing, and which, if continued, would never describe
circles. They are, consequently, more simple, but also more complex,
than a circle, which, however large or small it may be,
always has the same centre, and either includes others or is included
in others. This diversity was sought after by the Greeks
in works of all kinds; and their discernment of its beauty led
them to introduce the same system even into the form of their
utensils and vases, whose easy and elegant outline is drawn after
the same rule, that is, by a line which must be found by means of
several circles, for all these works have an elliptical figure, and
herein consists their beauty. The greater unity there is in the
junction of the forms, and in the flowing of one out of another, so
much the greater is the beauty of the whole.”</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Masculine and Feminine Beauty.</em>—The universality of curvature
as a form of beautiful objects throughout nature and art is
of importance in helping us to determine the question which is the
more beautiful form, a perfect man or a perfect woman—an Apollo
or a Venus? A Venus, no doubt. In those qualities which are
subsumed under the terms of the sublime or the characteristic—in
strength, manly dignity, intellectual power, majesty—the masculine
type, no doubt, is superior to the feminine. But in Beauty
proper—in the roundness and delicacy of contours, in the smoothness
of complexion and its subtle gradations of colour, in the
symmetrical roundness and lustrous expressiveness of the eyes—the
feminine type is pre-eminent.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Woman,” says Professor Kollmann, “is smaller, more delicate,
but also softer and more graceful (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>schwungvoller</i></span>) in form, in her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>breasts, hips, thighs, and calves. No line on her body is short
and sharply angular; they all swell, or vault themselves in a
gentle curve.... The neck and the rounded shoulders are connected
by gracefully curved lines, whereas a man’s neck is placed
more at a right angle to the more straight and angular shoulders....
The hair is softer, the skin more tender and transparent.
All the forms are more covered over with adipose tissue, and
connected by those gradual transitions which produce the gently
rounded outlines; whereas in a man everything—muscles, sinews,
blood-vessels, bones—is more conspicuous.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Schopenhauer, accordingly, was clearly in the wrong when he
endeavoured to make out that man is vastly superior to woman in
physical beauty,—a notion which Professor Huxley, too, does not
appear to disapprove of very violently. At the same time it is,
no doubt, true that there are more good specimens of masculine
beauty in most countries than of feminine beauty; true also that
man’s beauty lasts much longer than woman’s. A boy is more
beautiful than a girl under sixteen, for the very reason that his
form is more like that of an adult woman than a girl’s is. From
eighteen to twenty-five woman is more beautiful than man; while
after thirty, owing to the almost universal neglect of the laws of
health—women are apt to become either too rotund, which ruins
their grace and delicacy, or too angular—more angular than a man
under fifty.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>d</i>) <em>Delicacy and Grace.</em>—The difference between masculine
and feminine beauty and the superiority of the latter is also indirectly
brought out in Burke’s remarks on Delicacy, which,
though open to criticism in one or two points, are on the whole
admirable and exhaustive:—</p>

<p class='c001'>"An air of robustness and strength is very prejudicial to beauty.
An appearance of delicacy, and even of fragility, is almost essential
to it. Whoever examines the vegetable or animal creation will
find this observation to be founded in nature. It is not the oak,
the ash, or the elm, or any of the robust trees of the forest which
we consider as beautiful; they are awful and majestic, they inspire
a sort of reverence. It is the delicate myrtle, it is the orange, it
is the almond, it is the jasmine, it is the vine, which we look on
as vegetable beauties. It is the flowery species, so remarkable for
its weakness and momentary duration, that gives us the liveliest
idea of beauty and elegance. Among animals the greyhound is
more beautiful than the mastiff, and the delicacy of a jennet, a
barb, or an Arabian horse is much more amiable than the strength
and stability of some horses of war or carriage.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>“I need here say little of the fair sex, where I believe the
point will be easily allowed me. The beauty of women is considerably
owing to their weakness or delicacy, and is even enhanced
by their timidity, a quality of mind analogous to it. I would not
here be understood to say that weakness betraying very bad health
has any share in beauty; but the ill effect of this is not because
it is weakness, but because the ill state of health, which produces
such weakness, alters the other conditions of beauty; the parts in
such a case collapse, the bright colour, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lumen purpureum
juventæ</i></span> is gone, and the fine variation is lost in wrinkles, sudden
breaks, and right lines.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Delicacy is a quality closely related to grace, or beauty in
motion and attitude. “Grace,” says Dr. J. A. Symonds, “is a
striking illustration of the union of the two principles of similarity
and variety. For the secret of graceful action is that the symmetry
is preserved through all the varieties of position.” This is
well put; but the <em>first</em> condition and essence of grace is that there
must be an exact correspondence between the work done and the
limb which does it. The attitude of an oak-trunk, with nothing
on the top but a geranium bush, however symmetrical, would
always be ungraceful, owing to the ludicrous disproportion between
the support and the thing supported. Conversely, a weak fern-stalk,
trying to support a branch of heavy cactus leaves, would be
equally ungraceful; for there must be neither a waste of energy
nor a sense of effort. Part of this feeling may perhaps be traced
to sympathy—thus showing how various emotions enter into our
æsthetic judgments, sometimes weakening, sometimes strengthening
them. As Professor Bain remarks, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>à propos</i></span>: “We love to have
removed from our sight every aspect of suffering, and none more
so than the suffering of toil.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Grace is almost as powerful to inspire Love as Beauty itself.
Women know this instinctively, and in order to acquire the
Delicacy which leads to grace, they deprive their bodies of air and
sunshine and strengthening sleep, hoping thereby to acquire artificially,
through ill-health, what Nature has denied them. Fortunately
such violations of the laws of health always frustrate their
object. Delicacy conjoined with Health inspires Love, but delicacy
born of disease inspires only pity—a feeling which may inspire in
a woman what she imagines is Love, but in a man <em>never</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>e</i>) <em>Smoothness</em> is another attribute of Beauty on which Burke
was the first to place proper emphasis: It is, he says, “a
quality so essential to beauty that I do not recollect anything
beautiful that is not smooth. In trees and flowers, smooth leaves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>are beautiful; smooth slopes of earth in gardens; smooth streams
in the landscape; smooth coats of birds and beasts in animal
beauties; in fine women, smooth skins; and in several sorts of
ornamental furniture, smooth and polished surfaces.... Any
ruggedness, any sudden projection, any sharp angle, is in the
highest degree contrary to the idea of beauty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Though there are exceptions to this rule of smoothness—including
such a marvel of beauty as the moss-rose, as well as various
leaves covered with down, etc.—yet, on the whole, Burke is right.
Certainly the smooth white hand of a delicate lady is more beautiful
than the rough, horny “paws” of a bricklayer; and the inferior
beauty of a man’s arm is owing as much to its rough scattered
hairs as to the prominence of the muscles, in contrast to the smooth
and rounded arm of woman. In animals, however, hairs on the
limbs are not unbeautiful, because they are dense enough to overlap,
and thus form a hairy surface admirable alike for its soft
smoothness, its gloss, and its colour.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>f</i>) <em>Lustre and Colour.</em>—Lustrous, sparkling eyes, glossy hair,
pearly teeth,—where would human beauty be without them
without the delicate tints and blushes of the skin, the brown or blue
iris, the golden or chestnut locks, the ebony eyebrows and lashes?</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet the greatest art-critics incline to the opinion that, on the
whole, colour is a less essential ingredient of beauty than form.
“Colour assists beauty,” says Winckelmann, but “the essence of
beauty consists not in colour but in shape.” “A negro might be
called handsome when the conformation of his face is handsome.”
“The colour of bronze and of the black and greenish basalt does not
detract from the beauty of the antique heads,” hence “we possess
a knowledge of the beautiful, although in an unreal dress and of
a disagreeable colour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Similarly Mr. Ruskin, who remarks of colour that it “is richly
bestowed on the highest works of creation, and the eminent <em>sign
and seal of perfection in them</em>; being associated with <em>life</em> in the
human form, with <em>light</em> in the sky, with purity and hardness in
the earth,—death, night, and pollution of all kinds being colourless.
And although if form and colour be brought into complete
opposition, so that it should be put to us as a stern choice whether
we should have a work of art all of form, without colour (as an
Albert Dürer’s engraving), or all of colour, without form (as an
imitation of mother-of-pearl), form is beyond all comparison the
more precious of the two ... yet if colour be introduced at all,
it is necessary that, whatever else may be wrong, <em>that</em> should be
right,” etc.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>Again: “An oak is an oak, whether green with spring or red
with winter; a dahlia is a dahlia, whether it be yellow or crimson;
and if some monster-hunting botanist should ever frighten the
flower blue, still it will be a dahlia; but let one curve of the
petals—one groove of the stamens—be wanting, and the flower
ceases to be the same. Let the roughness of the bark and the
angles of the boughs be smoothed or diminished, and the oak ceases
to be an oak; but let it retain its inward structure and outward
form, and though its leaves grew white, or pink, or blue, or tricolour,
it would be a white oak, or a pink oak, or a republican oak,
but an oak still.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If we look at Nature carefully, we shall find that her colours
are in a state of perpetual confusion and indistinctness, while her
forms, as told by light and shade, are invariably clear, distinct,
and speaking. The stones and gravel of the bank catch green
reflections from the boughs above; the bushes receive grays and
yellows from the ground; every hairbreadth of polished surface
gives a little bit of the blue of the sky, or the gold of the sun, like
a star upon the local colour; this local colour, changeful and
uncertain in itself, is again disguised and modified by the hue of
the light or quenched in the gray of the shadow; and the confusion
and blending of tint is altogether so great that were we left to find
out what objects were by their colours only, we would scarcely in
place distinguish the boughs of a tree from the air beyond them or
the ground beneath them. I know that people unpractised in
art will not believe this at first; but if they have accurate powers
of observation, they may soon ascertain it for themselves; they
will find that, while they can scarcely ever determine the <em>exact</em> hue
of anything, except when it occurs in large masses, as in a green
field or the blue sky, the form, as told by light and shade, is
always decided and evident, and the source of the chief character
of every object.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Professor Bain remarks on this topic that “Among the several
kinds of beauty, the eye takes most delight in colour.... For
this reason we find the poets borrowing more of their epithets from
colours than from any other topic.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This view seems to be confirmed by the fact that lovers in
expatiating on the beauty of their Dulcineas seem to have much
more to say about their brown or golden locks, their light or dark
complexion, their blue or black eyes, than about the shape of their
features. This, however, partly finds its explanation in the fact
that colour, being a sensuous quality, is more easily and more
directly appreciated than form, the perception of which is a much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>more complicated matter, being a translation into intellectual terms
of remembered impressions of touch, associated with certain colours,
lights, and shades which recall them; and partly in the greater
ease with which peculiarities of colour are referred to than peculiarities
of form. In the days of ancient Greece the nomenclature
of colours was equally undeveloped, and is so vague in Homer that
Gladstone and Geiger actually set up the theory that Homer’s
colour-sense was imperfect, and that that sense has been gradually
developed within historic times,—a theory which I have confuted
on anatomical grounds in <cite>Macmillan’s Magazine</cite>, Dec. 1879.</p>

<p class='c001'>That as regards human beauty colour is of less importance than
form is shown, moreover, in this, that a girl with regular features
and a freckled complexion will much sooner find a lover than one
with the most delicately-coloured complexion, conjoined with a big
mouth, irregular nose, or sunken cheeks. And a beautifully-shaped
eye is sure to be admired by all, no matter whether blue, gray, or
brown; whereas an eye that is too small or otherwise defective in
form can never be redeemed by the most beautiful colour or
brilliancy.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, there are several things to be said in favour
of colour that will mitigate our judgment on this point. In the
first place, colour is more perfect in its way than form, so that it
is impossible ever to improve on it by idealising, as it is often with
form. As Mr. Ruskin remarks, “Form may be attained in perfection
by painters, who, in their course of study, are continually
altering or idealising it; but only the sternest fidelity will reach
colouring. Idealise or alter in that, and you are lost. Whether
you alter by debasing or exaggerating, by glare or by decline, one fate
is for you—ruin.... Colour is sacred in that you must keep to
facts. Hence the apparent anomaly that the only schools of colour
are the schools of realism.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, looking at Nature with an artist’s eye, Ruskin discovered
and frequently alludes to the “apparent connection of brilliancy
of colour with vigour of life,” and Mr. Wallace, looking at Nature
with a naturalist’s eye, established this “apparent connection” as
a scientific fact. The passage in which he sums up his views has
been once already quoted; but it is of such extreme importance in
enforcing the lesson that beauty is impossible without health, that
it may be quoted again:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“The colours of an animal usually fade during disease or weakness,
while robust health and vigour adds to its intensity.... In
all quadrupeds a ‘dull coat’ is indicative of ill-health or low condition;
while a glossy coat and sparkling eye are the invariable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>accompaniments of health and energy. The same rule applies to
the feathers of birds, whose colours are only seen in their purity
during perfect health; and a similar phenomenon occurs even
among insects, for the bright hues of caterpillars begin to fade as
soon as they become inactive, preparatory to their undergoing
transformation. Even in the Vegetable Kingdom we see the same
thing; for the tints of foliage are deepest, and the colours of
flowers and fruits richest, on those plants which are in the most
healthy and vigorous condition.”</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>g</i>) <em>Expression, Variety, Individuality.</em>—Besides the circumstances
that colour is more uniformly perfect in Nature than form,
and that it is always associated with Health, without which Beauty
is impossible, another peculiarity may be mentioned in its favour.
The complexion is a kaleidoscope whose delicate blushes and
constant changes of tint, from the ashen pallor of despair to the
rosy flush of delight, are the fascinating signs of emotional expression.
And herein lies the superior beauty of the human complexion
over all other tinted objects: it reflects not only the hues of
surrounding external bodies, but all the moods of the soul within.</p>

<p class='c001'>Form without colour is form without expression. But form
without expression soon ceases to fascinate, for we constantly crave
novelty and variety; and form is one, while expression is infinitely
varied and ever new. Herein lies the extreme importance of expression
as a test of Beauty. Colour, of course, is only one phase
of expression. The soul not only changes the tints of the complexion,
but liquifies the facial muscles so that they can be readily
moulded into forms characteristic of joy, sadness, hope, fear, adoration,
hatred, anger, affection, etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>Why is the portrait-painter so infinitely superior to the photographer?
Because the photographer—paradoxical as this may
seem—gives you a less realistic picture of yourself than the artist.
He only gives you the fixed form, or at most a transient expression
which, being fixed permanently, loses its essence, which is motion—and
thus becomes a caricature—an exaggeration in duration.
But the artist studies you by the hour, makes you talk, notes the
habitual forms of expression most characteristic of your individuality;
and, blending these into a sort of “typical portrait” of your
various individual traits, makes a picture which reveals all the
advantages of art over mere solar mechanism or photography.</p>

<p class='c001'>This explains why some of the most charming persons we know
never appear well in a photograph, while others much less charming
do. The beauty of the latter lies in form, of the former in
expression. But expression is much more potent to inspire admiration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>and Love than mere beauty of features; and not without
reason, for beautiful features, being a lucky inheritance, may be
conjoined with unamiable individual traits, whereas beautiful expression
is the infallible index of a beautiful mind and character;
and promises, moreover, beautiful sons and daughters, because
“expression is feature in the making.” It is by such subtle signs
and promises that Love is unconsciously and instinctively guided
in its choice.</p>

<p class='c001'>Formal Beauty alone is external and cold. It is those slight
variations in Beauty and expression which we call individuality
and character that excite emotion: so much so that Love, as we
have seen, is dependent on individuality, and a man who warmly
admires all beautiful women is in love with none.</p>

<p class='c001'>Speaking of the Greeks, Sir Charles Bell says: “In high art
it appears to have been the rule of the sculptor to divest the form
of expression.... In the Venus, the form is exquisite and the
face perfect, but there is <em>no expression</em> there; it has no human
softness, <em>nothing to love</em>.” “All individuality was studiously
avoided by the ancient sculptors in the representation of divinity;
they maintained the beauty of form and proportion, but without expression,
which, in their system, belonged exclusively to humanity.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But inasmuch as the Greeks attributed to their deities all the
various emotions which agitate man, why did they refuse them the
signs of expression? One cannot but suspect that the Greeks did
not sufficiently appreciate the beauty of expression. Had they
valued it more they would not have allowed their women to vegetate
in ignorance like flowers, one like the other, but would have
educated them and given them the individuality and expression
which alone can inspire Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, if the Greeks had been susceptible to the superior charms
of emotional expression, is it likely that they would have been so
completely absorbed in the two least expressive and emotional of
the arts—architecture and sculpture?</p>

<p class='c001'>We cannot avoid the conclusion that the Greeks were as indifferent
to the charms of individual expression as to Romantic Love,
which is dependent on it. In their statues, as Dr. Max Schasler
remarks, a mouth or eye has no more significance as a mark of
beauty than a well-shaped leg. Whereas in modern, and even
sometimes in mediæval art, what a world of expression in a mouth,
a pair of eyes!</p>

<p class='c001'>Leaving individual exceptions (like Homer) aside, it may be
said that the arts have been successively developed to a climax in
the order of their capacity for emotional expression, viz.—Architecture,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>Sculpture, Painting, Poetry, and Music. Poetry precedes
music, because though its emotional scope is wider, it is less
intense. To-day music is the most popular and universal of all
the arts because it stirs most deeply our feelings. And just as the
discovery of harmony, by individualising the melodies, has increased
the power and variety of music a thousandfold; so the individualisation
of Beauty and character through modern culture has made
Romantic Love a blessing accessible to all—the most prevalent
form of modern affection.</p>

<p class='c001'>Individuality is of such extreme importance in Love that a
slight blemish is not only pardoned but actually adored if it increases
the individuality. Bacon evidently had this in his mind
when he said that “there is no excellent beauty which has not some
strangeness in its proportion.” Seneca, as well as Ovid, noted the
attractiveness of slight short-comings; and the following anecdote
shows that though the Persians, as a nation, have ever been
strangers to Romantic Love, their greatest poet, Háfiz, understood
the psychology of the subject in its subtlest details:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“One day Timur (fourteenth century) sent for Háfiz and asked
angrily: ‘Art thou he who was so bold as to offer my two great
cities Samarkand and Bokhara for the black mole on thy mistress’s
cheek?’ alluding to a well-known verse in one of his odes. ‘Yes,
sire,’ replied Háfiz, ‘and it is by such acts of generosity that I
have brought myself to such a state of destitution that I have now
to solicit your bounty.’ Timur was so pleased with the ready wit
displayed in this answer that he dismissed the poet with a handsome
present.”</p>

<p class='c001'>To sum up: the reason why</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The rose that lives its little hour</div>
      <div class='line'>Is prized beyond the sculptured flower”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>is not, as Bryant implies, the transitoriness of the rose, but the fact
that the marble flower, like the wax-flower, is dead and unchangeable,
while the short-lived rose beams with the expression of happy
vitality after a shower, or sadly droops and hangs its head in a
drouth. It has life and expression, subtle gradations of colour,
and light and shade, which are the signs of its vitality and moods,
varying every day, every hour. And so with all the higher forms
of life, those always being most beautiful and highly prized which
are most capable of expressing subtle variations of health, happiness,
and mental refinement.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no part of the human body which does not serve as a
mark of expression—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>“In many’s looks the false heart’s history</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There’s language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,</div>
      <div class='line'><em>Nay, her foot speaks</em>.”—<span class='sc'>Shakspere.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>It will not do, therefore, to neglect any part of the body. As it
is the last straw which breaks the camel’s back, so Cupid’s capricious
choice is often determined by some minor point of perfection,
when the balance is otherwise equal. Suppose there are two sisters
whose faces, figures, and mental attractions are about equal; then
it is possible that one of them will die an old maid simply because
the other had a smaller foot, a more graceful gait, or longer eyelashes.</p>

<p class='c001'>But though every organ has its own beauty, there is an æsthetic
scale of lower and higher which corresponds pretty accurately with
the physical scale from down upwards—from the foot to the eye and
forehead. It is in this order, accordingly, that we shall now proceed
to consider the various parts of the human form, and those
peculiarities in them which are considered most beautiful and most
liable to inspire Romantic Love.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE FEET</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>SIZE</h3>

<p class='c011'>There is hardly anything concerning which vain people are so
sensitive as their feet. To have large feet is considered one of the
greatest misfortunes that can befall a woman. Mathematically
stated, the length of a woman’s skirts is directly proportional to
the size of her feet; and women with large feet are always shocked
at the frivolity of those who have neat ankles and coquettishly
allow them to be seen on occasion; nor do they see any beauty in
Sir John Suckling’s lines—</p>

<p class='c018'>Nor are men, as a rule, sufficiently free from pedal vanity to pose
as satirists. Byron found a mark of aristocracy in small feet, and
he was rendered almost as miserable by the morbid consciousness
of his own defects as Mme. de Staël (who had very ugly feet, yet
once ventured to assume the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span>, in private theatricals, of a statue)
was offended by Talleyrand’s witticism, that he recognised her by
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>pied de Staël</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>There is a <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>ben trovato</i></span>, if not true, story of a clever wife who
objected to her husband’s habit of spending his evenings away from
home, and who reformed him by utilising his vanity. By insisting
that his boots were too large, she repeatedly induced him to buy
smaller ones, which finally tortured him so much that he was only
too glad to stay at home and wear his slippers.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>FASHIONABLE UGLINESS</h3>

<p class='c013'>How universal is the desire to have, or appear to have, small
feet is shown by the fact that everybody blackens his shoes or
boots; for, owing to a peculiar optical delusion, black objects
always appear smaller than white ones; which is also the reason
why too slim and delicate ladies never appear to such advantage in
winter as they do in summer, when they exchange their dark for
light dresses.</p>

<p class='c001'>To a certain point the admiration of small feet is in accordance
with the canons of good Taste, as will be presently shown. But
Taste has a disease which is called Fashion. It is a sort of
microbe which has the effect of distorting and <em>exaggerating</em> everything
it takes hold of. Fashion is not satisfied with small feet;
it wants them <em>very</em> small, unnaturally small, at the cost of beauty,
health, grace, comfort, and happiness. Hence for many generations
shoemakers have been compelled to manufacture instruments
of torture so ruinous to the constitution of man and woman, that
an Austrian military surgeon has seriously counselled the enactment
of legal fines to be imposed on the makers of noxiously-shaped
shoes, similar to those imposed on food-adulterators.</p>

<p class='c001'>Most ugly and vulgar fashions come from France; but as regards
crippled feet the first prize has to be yielded to the Chinese,
even by the Parisians. The normal size of the human foot varies,
for men, from 9½ to 13; for women, from 5½ to 9 inches, man’s
feet being longer proportionately to the greater length of his lower
limbs. In China the men value the normal healthy condition of
their own feet enough to have introduced certain features of elasticity
in their shoes which we might copy with advantage; but the
women are treated very differently. “The fashionable length for
a Chinese foot,” says Dr. Jamieson, “is between 3½ and 4 inches,
but comparatively few parents succeed in arresting growth so completely.”
When girls are five years old their feet are tightly
wrapped up in bandages, which on successive occasions are tightened
more and more, till the surface ulcerates, and some of the flesh,
skin, and sometimes even a toe or two come off. “During the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>year,” says Professor Flower, “the pain is so intense that the
sufferer can do nothing but lie and cry and moan. For about two
years the foot aches continually, and is subject to a constant pain,
like the pricking of sharp needles.” Finally the foot becomes
reduced to a shapeless mass, void of sensibility, which “has now
the appearance of the hoof of some animal rather than a human
foot, and affords a very insufficient organ of support, as the peculiar
tottering gait of those possessing it clearly shows.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The difference between the Chinese belle and the Parisian is
one of degree merely. The former has her torturing done once
for all while a child, whereas the latter allows her tight, high-heeled
shoes to torture her throughout life. The English are the
only nation that have recognised the injuriousness and vulgarity of
the French shoe, and substituted one made on hygienic principles;
and as England has in almost everything else displaced France as
the leader in modern fashion, it is reasonable to hope that ere
long other nations will follow her in this reform. American girls
are, as a rule, much less sensible in this matter than their English
sisters; one need only ask a clerk in a shoe store to find out
how most of them endeavour to squeeze their small feet into
shoes too small by a number.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fashions are always followed blindly, without deliberation.
But would it not be worth while for French, American, and German
women—and many men too—to ask themselves what they
gain and what they lose by trying to make their feet appear
smaller than they are? The disadvantages outweigh the advantages
to an almost ludicrous extent.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the one side there is absolutely nothing but the gratification
of vanity derived from the fact that a few acquaintances
admire one’s “pretty feet”; and even this advantage is problematical,
because a person who wears too tight shoes can hardly
conceal them from an observer, and is therefore apt to get pity
for her vain weakness in place of admiration.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand are the following disadvantages:—</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) The constant torture of pressure (not to mention the resulting
corns and bunions), which alone must surely outweigh a hundred
times the pleasure of gratified vanity at having a Chinese foot.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) The unconscious distortion of the features and furrowing of
the forehead in the effort to endure and repress the pain,—and
wrinkles, be it remembered, when once formed are ineradicable.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) The discouragement of walking and other exercise, involving
a general lowering of vitality, sickly pallor and premature loss
of the bloom of youth.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>(4) The wasting of the calf of the leg to dimensions characteristic
of savagedom, disease, and old age, not to speak of the
numerous maladies resulting to women from the use of hard high
heels of fashionable shoes, every contact of which with the ground
sends a shock through the spinal column to the brain and produces
obscure disorders in various parts of the organism.</p>

<p class='c001'>(5) The mutilation of one of the most beautiful and characteristically
human parts of the body. As the author of Harper’s
<cite>Ugly Girl Papers</cite> remarks: “One’s foot is as proper an object of
pride and complacency as a shapely hand. But where in a
thousand would a sculptor find one that was a pleasure to contemplate
like that of the Princess Pauline Bonaparte, whose lovely foot
was modelled in marble for the delight of all the world who have
seen it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>(6) Finally, and most important of all, the loss of a graceful
gait, of the poetry of motion, which is a thousand times more
calculated to inspire admiration—æsthetic or erotic—than a small
foot.</p>

<p class='c001'>Man is said to be a reasoning animal; and man embraces
woman. But surely in matters of fashion woman is not a reasoning
being. Very large feet being properly regarded as ugly, she
draws the inference that the smaller they can be made the more
will they be beautiful; forgetting that Beauty is a matter of proportion,
not of absolute size. A foot may, like a waist, as easily
appear ugly from being too small as from being too large. A large
woman with very small feet cannot but make a disagreeable impression,
like a bust on an insecure pedestal or a leaning tower.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>TESTS OF BEAUTY</h3>

<p class='c013'>According to Schopenhauer, the great value which all attach to
small feet “depends on the fact that small feet are an essentially
human characteristic, since in no animal are the tarsus and metatarsus
together so small as in man, which peculiarity is connected
with his erect attitude: he is a plantigrade.” But it is difficult to
see any force in this reasoning, since not one person in a hundred
thousand knows what the bones called tarsus and metatarsus are,
nor cares whether they are larger in man or in animals; while, as
regards the upright position, large feet would appear more suitable
for maintaining it than small ones.</p>

<p class='c001'>If smallness were the test of beauty in man, why should we
not feel ashamed to have larger heads than animals, or envy the
elephant, who, for his size, has the smallest foot of all animals?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>Those who believe that human beauty consists in the degree
of remoteness from animal types, will derive satisfaction from the
fact that apes have feet that are larger than ours. Topinard gives
these figures showing the relative sizes: man, 16·96; gorilla,
20·69; chimpanzee, 21·00; orang, 25. But why should man
feel a special pride in the fact that his feet are somewhat smaller
than those of his nearest relatives, whom, until recently, he did
not even acknowledge as such?</p>

<p class='c001'>It is, moreover, unscientific to compare man’s foot with the ape’s
too closely, because they have different functions—being used by
man for walking, by the ape for climbing—and therefore require
different characteristics. It is only in those organs that have a
like function—as the jaws, teeth, nose, eyes, and forehead—that a
direct comparison is permissible, and a progress noted in our
favour.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, as M. Topinard tells us, “The hand and the foot of
man, although shorter than those of the anthropoid ape, do not
vary among races according to their order of superiority, as we
should have supposed. <em>A long hand or foot is not a characteristic
of inferiority.</em>”</p>

<p class='c001'>The same is true among individuals of the same race. Mme.
de Staël was one of the most intelligent women the world has ever
seen, yet her feet were very large; and conversely, some of our
silliest girls have the smallest feet.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since, then, there is no obvious connection between small feet
and superior culture, it follows that the beauty of a foot is not to
be determined by so simple a matter as its length. There are other
peculiarities, of greater importance, in which the laws of Beauty
manifest themselves. First, in the arched instep, which is not
only attractive because it introduces the beauty-curve in place of
the straight, flat line of the sole, but which is of the utmost importance
in increasing the foot’s capacity for carrying its burden,
just as architects build arches under bridges, etc., for the sake of
the greater strength and more equable distribution of pressure thus
obtained. Secondly, in the symmetrical correspondence of the toes
and contours of one foot with those of its partner; in the gradation
of the regularly shortened toes, from the first to the fifth; in the
delicate tints of the skin which, moreover, is smooth and not (as
in apes) covered with straggling hairs and deep furrows, which
would have concealed the delicate veins that variegate the surface,
and give it the colour of life.</p>

<p class='c001'>Professor Carl Vogt, in his <cite>Lectures on Man</cite>, vividly illustrates
the principles on which our judgment regarding beauty in feet is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>based, by comparing a negro’s foot with that of civilised man:
“The foot of the negro, says Burmeister, produces a disagreeable
impression. Everything in it is ugly; the flatness, the projecting
heel, the thick, fatty cushion in the inner cavity, the spreading
toes.... The character of the human foot lies mainly in its
arched structure, in the predominance of the metatarsus, the
shortening and equal direction of the toes, among which the great
toe is remarkably long, but not, like the thumb, opposable....
The toes in standing leave no mark, but do so in progression.
The whole middle part of the foot does not touch the ground.
Persons with flat feet, in whom the middle of the sole touches
ground, are bad pedestrians, and are rejected as recruits....
The negro is a decided flat foot ... the fat cushion on the sole
not only fills up the whole cavity, but projects beyond the surface.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Inasmuch as it is the custom among all civilised peoples to
cover the foot entirely, many of its aspects of beauty are rendered
invisible permanently, so that it is perhaps not to be wondered at
that in their absence Fashion should have so eagerly fixed on the
two visible features—size and arched instep—and endeavoured to
exaggerate them by Procrustean dimensions and stilt-like high
heels. Yet in this matter even modern Parisians represent a
progress over the mediæval Venetian ladies, who, according to
Marinello, at one time wore soles and heels over a foot in height,
so that on going out they had to be accompanied by several
servants to prevent them from falling. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Mais que voulez vous?</i></span>
Fashion is fashion, and women are women.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the ancient Greeks the feet were frequently exposed to
view; hence, says Winckelmann, “in descriptions of beautiful
persons, as Polyxena and Aspasia, even their beautiful feet are
mentioned.” Possibly in some future age, when Health and
Beauty will be more worshipped than vulgar Fashion fetishes, a
clever Yankee will invent an elastic, tough, and leathery, but
transparent substance that will protect the foot while fitting it
like a glove and showing its outlines. This would put an end to
the mutilations resorted to from vanity, guided by bad taste, and
would add one more feature to Personal Beauty. And the foot,
as Burmeister insists, has one advantage over every other part of
the body. Beauty in all these other features depends on health
and a certain muscular roundness. But the foot’s beauty is
independent of such variations, as it lies mainly in its permanent
bony contours and in its fat cushion, which alone of all adipose
layers resists the ravages of disease and old age. Hence a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>beautiful foot is a thing of beauty and a joy for ever, long after
all other youthful charms have faded and fled.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>A GRACEFUL GAIT</h3>

<p class='c013'>So long as the foot remains entirely covered, its beauty is, on
the whole, of less importance than the grace of its movements.
Grace, under all circumstances, is as potent a love-charm as
Beauty itself—of which, in fact, it is only a phase; and if young
men and women could be made to realise how much they could
add to their fascinations by cultivating a graceful gait and
attitudes, hygienic shoemakers, dancing-masters, and gymnasiums
would enjoy as great and sudden a popularity as skating-rinks,
and a much more permanent popularity too.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is the laws of Grace that chiefly determine the most admirable
characteristics of the foot. The arched instep is beautiful
because of its curved outlines; but its greatest value lies in the
superior elasticity and grace it imparts to the gait. The habitual
carrying of heavy loads tends to make the feet flat and to ruin
Grace; hence the clumsy gait of most working people, and, on
the other hand, the graceful walk of the “aristocratic” classes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The proper size of the foot, again, is most easily determined
with reference to the principles of Grace. Motion is graceful
when it does not involve any waste of energy, and when it is in
accordance with the lines of Beauty. There must be no disproportion
between the machinery and the work done—no locomotive
to pull a baby-carriage. Too large feet are ugly because they
appear to have been made for carrying a giant; too small ones
are ugly because seemingly belonging to a dwarf. What are the
exact proportions lying between “too large” and “too small” can
only be determined by those who have educated their taste by the
study of the laws of Beauty and Grace throughout Nature.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this point of view Grace is synonymous with <em>functional
fitness</em>. A monkey’s foot is less beautiful than a man’s, but in
<em>climbing</em> it is more graceful; whereas in <em>walking</em> man’s is
infinitely more graceful. Apes rarely assume an erect position,
and when they do so they never walk on the flat sole. “When
the orang-outang takes to the ground,” says Mr. E. B. Tylor, “he
shambles <em>clumsily</em> along, generally putting down the outer edge of
the foot and the bent knuckles of the hand.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I have italicised the word “clumsily” because it touches the
vital point of the question. Man owes his intellectual superiority
largely to the fact that he does not need his hands for walking or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>climbing, but uses them as organs of delicate touch and as tools.
To acquire this independence of the hands he needed feet, which
enabled him to stand erect and walk along, not “clumsily,” but
firmly, naturally, and therefore gracefully. Hence in course of
time, through the effects of constant use, there was developed the
callous cushion of the heel and toes; while, through discontinuance
of the habit of climbing, the toes became reduced in size.
In the ape’s foot, it is well known, the toes are almost as long as
the fingers of the hand: a fact which led Blumenbach and Cuvier
to classify apes as quadrumana or four-<em>handed</em> animals. But
Professor Huxley showed that this classification was based on
erroneous reasoning. The resemblance between the hands and
feet of apes is merely <em>physiological</em> or functional—because hands
and feet are used alike for climbing. But <em>anatomically</em>, in its
bones and muscles, etc., the monkey’s apparent hind “hand” is a
true foot no less than man’s. If the <em>physiological</em> function, <i>i.e.</i>
the opposability of the thumb to the other fingers, were taken as
a ground of classification, then birds, who have such toes, would
have no feet at all but only wings and hands.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a limit, however, beyond which the size of man’s toe’s
cannot be reduced without injuring the foot’s usefulness and the
grace of gait. The front part of the foot is distinguished for its
yielding or elastic character. Hence, says Professor Humphrey,
“in descending from a height, as from a chair or in walking
downstairs, we alight upon the balls of the toes. If we alight
upon the heels—for instance, if we walk downstairs on the heels—we
find it an uncomfortable and rather jarring procedure. In
walking and jumping, it is true, the heels come first in contact
with the ground, but the weight then falls obliquely upon them,
and is not fully borne by the foot till the toes also are upon the
ground.”</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the reasons why Grace is more rare even than Beauty
on this planet is that the toes are cramped or even turned out of
their natural position by tight, pointed, fashionable shoes, and
are thus prevented from giving elasticity to the step. Instances
are not rare (and by no means only in China) where the great toe
is almost at right angles to the length of the foot. In walking,
says Professor Flower, “the heel is first lifted from the ground,
and the weight of the body gradually transferred through the
middle to the anterior end of the foot, and the final push or
impulse given with the great toe. It is necessary then that all
these parts should be in a straight line with one another.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a mooted question whether the toes should be slightly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>turned outward, as dancing-masters insist, or placed in straight
parallel lines, as some physiologists hold. For the reason
indicated in the last paragraph, physiologists are clearly right.
With parallel or almost parallel great toes, a graceful walk is
more easily attained than by turning out the toes. Even in
standing, Dr. T. S. Ellis argues, the parallel position is preferable:
“When a body stands on four points I know of no reason why it
should stand more firmly if those points be unequally disposed.
The tendency to fall forwards would seem to be even increased by
widening the distance between the points in front, and it is in
this direction that falls most commonly occur.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>EVOLUTION OF THE GREAT TOE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps the most striking difference between the feet of men
and apes lies in the relative size of the first and second toes. In
the ape’s foot the second toe is longer than the first, whereas in
modern civilised man’s foot the first or great toe is almost always
the longer. Not so, however, with savages, who are intermediate
in this as in other respects between man and ape; and there are
various other facts which seem to indicate that the evolution of
the great toe, like that of the other extreme of the body—the
head and brain—is still in progress.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a notion very prevalent among artists that the second
toe should be longer than the first. This idea, Professor Flower
thinks, is derived from the Greek canon, which in its turn was
copied from the Egyptian, and probably originally derived from
the negro. It certainly does not represent what is most usual in
our race and time. “Among hundreds of bare, and therefore
undeformed, feet of children I lately examined in Perthshire, I
was not able to find one in which the second toe was the longest.
Since in all apes—in fact, in all other animals—the first toe is
considerably shorter than the second, a long first toe is a specially
human attribute; and instead of being despised by artists, it
should be looked upon as a mark of elevation in the scale of
organised beings.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. J. P. Harrison, after a careful examination of the unrestored
feet of Greek and Roman statues in various museums and art
galleries, wrote an article in the <cite>Journal of the Anthropological
Institute of Great Britain</cite> (vol. xiii. 1884), in which he states that
he was “led to the conviction that it was from Italy and not
Greece that the long second toe affected by many English artists
had been imported.” Among the Italians a longer second toe is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>common, as also among Alsatians; in England so rarely that its
occurrence probably indicates foreign blood. Professor Flower, as
we have seen, found no cases at all; Paget examined twenty-seven
English males, in twenty-four of whom the great toe was the longer.
“In the case of the female feet, in ten out of twenty-three subjects
the first or great toe was longest, and <em>in ten females it was
shorter</em> than the second toe. In the remaining three instances the
first and second toes were of equal length.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bear these last sentences in mind a moment, till we have seen
what is the case with savages. Says Dr. Bruner: “A slight
shortening of the great toe undoubtedly exists, not merely amongst
the Negro tribes, but also in ancient and modern Egyptians, and even
in some of the most beautiful races of Caucasian <em>females</em>.” And Mr.
Harrison found this to be, with a few exceptions, a general trait of
savages. The great toe was shorter than the second in skeletons
of Peruvians, Tahitians, New Hebrideans, Savage islanders, Ainos,
New Caledonians.</p>

<p class='c001'>Must we therefore agree with Carl Vogt when he says, “We
may be sure that, whenever we perceive an approach to the animal
type, the female is nearer to it than the male”?</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps, however, we can find a solution of the problem <em>somewhat</em>
less insulting to women than this statement of the ungallant
German professor.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is <em>Fashion</em>, the handmaid of ugliness, that has thus apparently
caused almost half the women to approximate the simian
type of the foot; <em>Fashion</em>, which, by inducing women for centuries
to thrust their tender feet into Spanish boots of torture, has taken
from their toes the freedom of action requisite for that free development
and growth which is to be noticed in almost all the men.</p>

<p class='c001'>Considering the great difference between the left and the right
foot, it appears almost incredible, but is a sober fact, that until
about half a century ago “rights and lefts” were not made even
for the men, who now always wear them. But even to-day “they
are not, it is believed, made use of by women, except in a shape
that is little efficacious,” says Mr. Harrison; and concerning the
Austrians Dr. Schaffer remarks, similarly, that “the like shoe for
the left and right foot is still in use in the vast majority of cases.”
No wonder women are so averse to taking exercise, and therefore
lose their beauty at a time when it ought to be still in full bloom.
For to walk in such shoes must be a torture forbidding all unnecessary
movement.</p>

<p class='c001'>Once more be it said—it is Fashion, the handmaid of ugliness,
that is responsible for the inferior beauty of the average female
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>foot, by preventing the free development and play of the toes
which are absolutely necessary for a graceful walk.</p>

<p class='c001'>To what an extent the woful rarity of a graceful gait is due to
the shape of “fashionable” shoes is vividly brought out in a passage
concerning the natives of Martinique, which appeared in a letter in
the New York <cite>Evening Post</cite>: “Many of the quadroons are handsome,
even beautiful, in their youth, and all the women of pure
black and mixed blood walk with a lightness of step and a graceful
freedom of motion that is very noticeable and pleasant to see. I
say all the women; but I must confine this description to those
who go shoeless, for when a negress crams her feet into even the
best-fitting pair of shoes her gait becomes as awkward as the
waddle of an Indian squaw, or of a black swan on dry land, and she
minces and totters in such danger of falling forward that one feels
constrained to go to her and say, ‘Mam’selle Ebène or Noirette, do,
I beseech you, put your shoes where you carry everything else,
namely, on the top of your well-balanced head, and do let me see
you walk barefoot again, for I do assure you that neither your
Chinese cousins nor your European mistresses can ever hope to
imitate your goddess-like gait until they practise the art of walking
with their high-heeled, tiny boots nicely balanced on <em>their</em>
heads, as you so often are pleased to do.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>There is another lesson to be learned from this discussion,
namely, that in trying to establish the principles of Beauty, it is
better to follow one’s own taste than adhere blindly to Greek
canons, and what are supposed to be Greek canons. The
longer second toe, as we have seen, is not a characteristic of
Greek art, but due apparently to restorations made in Italy
where this peculiarity prevails. The Greeks, indeed, never
hesitated to idealise and improve Nature if caught napping;
and there can be little doubt that if in their own feet the first toe
had been shorter than the second, they would have made it longer
all the same in their statues, following the laws of gradation and
curvature which a longer second toe would interrupt. For it is
undeniable that, as Mr. Harrison remarks, “a model foot, according
to Flaxman, is one in which the toes follow each other imperceptibly
in a graceful curve from the first or great toe to the fifth.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>NATIONAL DIFFERENCES</h3>

<p class='c013'>The statement made above regarding the prevalence among
Italians of a longer second toe enables us also to qualify the
remark made in the <cite>Westminster Review</cite> (1884), that “Even
at the present day it is a fact well known to all sculptors that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>Italy possesses the finest models as regards the female hands and
feet in any part of Europe; and that to the eye of an Italian the
wrists and ankles of most English women would not serve as a
study even for those revivalisms of the antique which are to be
purchased in our streets for a few shillings.” Whatever may be
true of wrists and ankles, the toes must be excepted, at least if a
larger percentage of Italian than of English women have the second
toe longer.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although in matters where so many individual differences exist
it is hazardous to generalise, the following remarks on national
peculiarities in feet, made by a reviewer of Zachariae’s <cite>Diseases of
the Human Foot</cite>, may be cited for what they are worth: “The
French foot is meagre, narrow, and bony; the Spanish foot is
small and elegantly curved, thanks to its Moorish blood.... The
Arab foot is proverbial for its high arch; ‘a stream can run under
his foot,’ is a description of its form. The foot of the Scotch is
large and thick—that of the Irish flat and square—the English
short and fleshy. The American foot is apt to be disproportionately
small.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>BEAUTIFYING HYGIENE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Walking, running, and dancing are the most potent cosmetics
for producing a foot beautiful in form and graceful in movement.
It is possible that much walking does slightly increase the size of
the foot, but not enough to become perceptible in the life of an
individual; and it has been sufficiently shown that the standard of
Beauty in a foot is not smallness but curved outlines, litheness, and
grace of gait, these qualities being a thousand times more powerful
“love-charms” than the smallest Chinese foot. Moreover, it is
probable that <em>graceful</em> walking has no tendency to enlarge the foot
as a whole, but only the great toe; and a well-developed great toe
is a distinctive sign of higher evolution.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is useless for any one to try to walk or dance gracefully in
shoes which do not allow the toes to spread and act like two sets
of elastic springs. One of the most curious aberrations of modern
taste is the notion that the shape of the natural foot is not beautiful—that
it will look better if made narrowest in front instead
of widest. Even were this so, it would not pay to sacrifice all
grace to a slight gain in Beauty. But it is not so. It is only
habit, which blunts perception, that makes us indifferent to the
ugliness of the pointed shoes in our shop-windows, or even in many
cases prefer them to naturally-shaped shoes. Were we once accustomed
to properly-shaped hygienic boots, in which no part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>foot is cramped, our present shoes, with their unnatural curves
where there should be none, and the absence of curves where they
should be (“rights and lefts”), would seem as “awful” and
“horrid” as the old crinoline does to the eyes of the present
generation. As Professor Flower remarks: “The fact that the
excessively pointed, elongated toes of the time of Richard II., for
instance, were superseded by the broad, round-toed, almost elephantine,
but most comfortable shoes seen in the portraits of Henry
VIII. and his contemporaries, shows that there is nothing in the
former essential to the gratification of the æsthetic instincts of
mankind. Each form was, doubtless, equally admired in the time
of its prevalence.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Germans claim that it was one of their countrymen, Petrus
Camper, who first called attention, about a hundred years ago, to
another objectionable peculiarity of the modern shoe—its high
heels—ruinous alike to comfort, grace, and health (a number of
female diseases being caused by them); yet they admit that Camper’s
advice was hardly heeded by the Germans, and that it therefore
serves them right that quite recently the modern hygienic
shoe, with low, broad heels, has been introduced in Germany as
the “English form,” the English having proved themselves less
obtuse and conservative in this matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>The heel is, however, capable of still further improvement. It
is not elastic like the cushion of the heel, after which it should be
modelled; and Dr. Schaffer’s suggestion that an elastic mechanism
should be introduced in the heel is certainly worthy of trial.
Everybody knows how much more lightly, gracefully, as well as
noiselessly, he can walk in rubbers than in leather shoes; and this
gain is owing to the superior elasticity of the heel and the middle
part of the shoe, covering the arch, which should be especially
elastic. It is pleasanter to walk in a meadow than on a stone
pavement; but if we wear soles that are both soft and elastic we
need never walk on a hard surface; for then, as Dr. Schaffer
remarks, “we have the meadow in our boots.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As the left foot always differs considerably from the right, it is
not sufficient to have one measure taken. The fact that shoemakers
do take but one measure shows what clumsy bunglers most of
them are. As a rule, it is easier to get a fit from a large stock of
ready-made boots than at a shoemaker’s.</p>

<p class='c001'>The stockings, as well as the shoes, often cramp and deform
the foot; and Professor Flower suggests that they should never
be made with pointed toes, or similar forms for both sides.
Digitated stockings, however, are a nuisance, for they hamper the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>free and elastic action of the toes. Woollen stockings are the best
both for summer and winter use. No one who has ever experienced
the comfort of wearing woollen socks (and underclothes in
general), will ever dream of reverting to silk, cotton, or any other
material.</p>

<p class='c001'>Soaking the feet in water in which a handful of salt has been
dissolved, several times a week, is an excellent way of keeping the
skin in sound condition. For perfect cleanliness it does not suffice
to change the socks frequently. As the author of the <cite>Ugly Girl
Papers</cite> remarks, “The time will come when we will find it as
shocking to our ideas to wear out a pair of boots without putting
in new lining as we think the habits of George the First’s time,
when maids of honour went without washing their faces for a
week, and people wore out their linen without the aid of a
laundress.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>DANCING AND GRACE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Among the ancients dancing included graceful gestures and
poses of all parts of the body, as well as facial expression. In
Oriental dancing of the present day, likewise, graceful movements
of the arms and upper part of the body play a more important <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span>
than the lower limbs. Modern dancing, on the contrary, is chiefly
an affair of the lower extremities. It is pre-eminently an exercise
of the toes; and herein lies its hygienic and beautifying value, for,
as we have seen, grace of gait depends chiefly on the firm litheness
and springiness of the toes, especially the great toe. By their
grace of gait one can almost always distinguish persons who have
enjoyed the privilege of dancing-lessons, which have strengthened
their toes and, by implication, many other muscles, not forgetting
those of the arm, which has to hold the partner.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are thousands of young women who have no opportunities
for prolonged and exhilarating exercise except in ballrooms. In
the majority of cases, unfortunately, Fashion, the handmaid of
Ugliness and Disease, frustrates the advantages which would
result from dancing by prescribing for ballrooms not only the
smallest shoes, but the tightest corsets and the lowest dresses,
which render it impossible or imprudent to breathe fresh air,
without which exercise is of no hygienic value, and may even be
injurious. But what are such trifling sacrifices as Health,
Beauty, and Grace compared to the glorious consciousness of
being fashionable!</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>DANCING AND COURTSHIP</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The ballroom is Cupid’s camping ground, not only because it
facilitates the acquisition of that grace by which he is so easily
enamoured, but because it affords such excellent opportunities for
Courtship and Sexual Selection. And this applies not only to the
era of modern Romantic Love, but, from its most primitive manifestations
in the animal world, dancing, like song, has been
connected with love and courtship.</p>

<p class='c001'>Darwin devotes several pages to a description of the love-antics
and dances of birds. Some of them, as the black African weaver,
perform their love-antics on the wing, “gliding through the air
with quivering wings, which make a rapid whirring sound like a
child’s rattle;” others remain on the ground, like the English
white-throat, which “flutters with a fitful and fantastic motion;”
or the English bustard, who “throws himself into indescribably
odd attitudes whilst courting the female;” and a third class, the
famous Bower-birds, perform their love-antics in bowers specially
constructed and adorned with leaves, shells, and feathers. These
are the earliest <em>ballrooms</em> known in natural history; and it is
quite proper to call them so, for, as Darwin remarks, they “are
built on the ground for the sole purpose of courtship, for their
nests are formed in trees.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Passing on to primitive man, we again find him inferior to
animals in not knowing that the sole proper function of dancing is
in the service of Love, courtship, and grace. Savages have three
classes of dance, two being performed by the men alone, the third
by men and women. First come the war-dances, in which the
grotesquely-painted warriors brandish their spears and utter unearthly
howls, to excite themselves for an approaching contest.
Second, the Hunter’s Dances, in which the game is impersonated
by some of the men and chased about, which leads to many comic
scenes; though there is a serious undercurrent of superstition, for
they believe that such dances—a sort of saltatorial prayer—bring
on good luck in the subsequent real chase. Third, the dance of
Love, practised <i>e.g.</i> by the Brazilian Indians, with whom “men
and women dance a rude courting dance, advancing in lines with
a kind of primitive polka step” (Tylor.) That there is as little
refinement and idealism in the savage’s dances as in his love-affairs
in general is self-evident.</p>

<p class='c001'>The civilised nations of antiquity, as we have seen, had no
prolonged Courtship, and therefore no Romantic Love. Since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>young men and women were not allowed to meet freely, dancing
was of course not esteemed as a high social accomplishment. It
was therefore commonly relegated to a special class of women (or
slaves), such as the Bayaderes of India and the Greek flute girls.
Notwithstanding that even the Greek gods are sometimes represented
as dancing, yet this art came to be considered a sign of
effeminacy in men who indulged in it; and as for the Romans, their
view is indicated in Cicero’s anathema: “No man who is sober
dances, unless he is out of his mind, either when alone or in decent
society, for dancing is the companion of wanton conviviality,
dissoluteness, and luxury.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In ancient Egypt, too, the upper classes were not allowed to
learn dancing. And herein, as in so many things in which women
are concerned, the modern Oriental is the direct descendant of the
ancients. “In the eyes of the Chinese,” says M. Letourneau,
“dancing is a ridiculous amusement by which a man compromises
his dignity.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Plato appears to have been the first who recognised the importance
of dancing as affording opportunities for Courtship and
pre-matrimonial acquaintance. But his advice remained unheeded
by his countrymen. A view regarding dancing similar to Plato’s
was announced by an uncommonly liberal theologian of the sixteenth
century in the words, as quoted by Scherr, that “Dancing had
been originally arranged and permitted with the respectable
purpose of teaching manners to the young in the presence of many
people, and enabling young men and maidens to form honest
attachments. For in the dance it was easy to observe and note
the habits and peculiarities of the young.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus we see that, with the exception of the savage’s war-dances
and hunting pantomimes, the art of dancing has at all times and
everywhere been born of love; even the ancient religious dances
having commonly been but a veil concealing other purposes, as
among the Greeks. But all ceremonial dancing, like ceremonial
kissing, has been from the beginning doomed to be absorbed and
annihilated by the all-engrossing modern passion of Romantic Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>True, as a miser mistakes the means for the end and loves gold
for its own sake, so we sometimes see girls dance alone—possibly
with a vaguely coy intention of giving the men to understand that
they can get along without them. But their heart is not in it, and
they never do it when there are men enough to go round. As for
the men, they are too open and frank ever to veil their sentiments.
They never dance except with a woman.</p>

<p class='c001'>To-day our fashion and society papers are eternally complaining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>of the fact that the young men—especially the <em>desirable</em> young
men—seem to have lost all interest in dancing. But who is to
blame for this? Certainly not the men. It is <em>Fashion</em> again,
and the mothers who sacrifice the matrimonial prospects of their
daughters—as well as their Health, Beauty, and Individuality—to
this hideous fetish. It is the late hours of the dance, prescribed
by Fashion, that are responsible for the apparent loss of masculine
interest in this art. Formerly, when aristocracy meant laziness
and stupidity, the habit of turning night into day was harmless
or even useful, because it helped to rid the world prematurely of a
lot of fools. But to-day the leading men of the community are
also the busiest. Aristocracy implies activity, intellectual and
otherwise. Hence there are few men in the higher ranks who
have not their regular work to do during the day. To ask them
after a day’s hard labour to go to a dance beginning at midnight
and ending at four or five is to ask them to commit suicide.
Sensible men do not believe in slow suicide, hence they avoid
dancing-parties as if such parties were held in small-pox hospitals.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let society women throw their stupid conservatism to the
winds. Let them arrange balls to begin at eight or nine and end
at midnight or one, and “desirable” men will be only too eager
to flock to assemblies which they now shun. The result will be a
sudden and startling diminution in the number of old maids and
bachelors.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is the <em>moral duty</em> of mothers who have marriageable daughters
to encourage this reform. Maternal love does not merely
imply solicitude for the first twenty years of a daughter’s life, but
careful provision for the remainder of her life, covering twice that
period, by enabling her to meet and choose a husband after her
own heart</p>

<h3 class='c014'>EVOLUTION OF DANCE MUSIC</h3>

<p class='c013'>Did space permit, it would be interesting to study in detail the
dances of various epochs and countries, coloured, like the Love
which originated them, by national peculiarities—the Polish
mazourka and polonaise, the Spanish fandango, the Viennese
waltz, the Parisian cancan, etc. Suffice it to note the great
difference between the dances of a few generations ago and those
of to-day, as shown most vividly in the evolution of dance-music.</p>

<p class='c001'>The earliest dance-tunes are vocal, and were sung by the (professional)
dancers themselves, in the days when the young were
not yet allowed to meet, converse, and flirt and dance. Subsequently,
the transference of dance-music to instruments played by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>others gave the dancers opportunity to perform more complicated
figures, and made it possible to converse. But even as late as the
eighteenth century dancing and dance-music were characterised by
a stately reserve, slowness, and pompous dignity which showed at
once that they had nothing to do with Romantic Love. It was
not the fiery, passionate youths who danced these solemnly stupid
minuets, gavottes, sarabandes, and allemandes, but the older folks,
whose perruques, and collars, and frills, and bloated clothes would
not have enabled them to execute rapid movements even if the
warm blood of youth had coursed in their veins.</p>

<p class='c001'>How all this artificiality and snail-like pomp has been brushed
away by triumphant Romantic Love, which has secured for modern
lovers the privilege of dancing together before they are married
and cease to care for it! True, we still have the monotonous
soporific quadrille, as if to remind us of bygone times; but the
true modern dance is the round dance, which differs from the
stately mediæval dance as a jolly rural picnic does from a formal
morning call.</p>

<p class='c001'>The difference between the mediæval and the modern dance is
thus indicated by F. Bremer:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Peculiar to modern dance-music is the round dance, especially
the waltz; and it is in consequence warmer than the older dance-music,
more passionate in expression, in rhythm and modulation
more sharply accented. As its creator we must regard Carl Maria
von Weber, who, in his <cite>Invitation to Dance</cite>, struck the keynote
through which subsequently, in the music of Chopin, Lanner,
Strauss, Musard, etc., utterance was given to the whole gamut
of dreamy, languishing, sentimental, ardent passion. The consequence
was the displacement of the stately, measured dances
by impetuous, chivalrous forms; and in place of the former naïve
sentimentality and childish mirth, it is the <em>rapture of Love</em> that
constitutes the spirit of modern dance-music.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Not to speak of more primitive dance-tunes, what a difference
there is between the slow and dreary monotony of eighteenth century
dances and a Viennese waltz of to-day! The vast superiority
of a Strauss waltz lies in this—that it is no longer a mere rhythmic
noise calculated to guide the steps, and skips, and bows, and evolutions
of the dancers, but <em>the symphonic accompaniment to the first
act in the drama of Romantic Love</em>. It recognises the fact that
Courtship is the prime object of the dance. Hence, though still
bound by the inevitable dance rhythm, Strauss is ever trying to
break loose from it, to secure that freedom and variety of rhythm
which is needed to give full utterance to passion. Note the slow,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>pathetic introductions; the signs in the score indicating an accelerated
or retarded tempo when the waltz is played at a concert,
where the uniformity of ballroom movement is not called for; note
what subtle use he makes of all the other means of expressing
amorous feeling—the wide melodic intervals, the piquant, stirring
harmonies, the exquisitely melancholy flashes of instrumental
colouring, alternating with cheerful moments, showing a subtle
psychologic art of translating the Mixed Moods of Love into the
language of tones.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the waltzes, mazourkas, and polonaises of Chopin we see still
more strikingly that the true function of dance-music is amorous.
Even as Dante’s Love for Beatrice was too super-sensual, too
ethereal for this world, so Chopin’s dance-pieces are too subtle,
too full of delicate <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>nuances</i></span> of <em>tempo</em> and Love episodes, to be
adapted to a ballroom with ordinary mortals. Graceful fairies
alone could dance a Chopin waltz; mortals are too heavy, too
clumsy. They can follow an amorous Chopin waltz with the
imagination alone, which is the abode of Romantic Love. To a
Strauss waltz a hundred couples may make love at once, hence he
writes for the orchestra; but Chopin wrote for the parlour piano,
because the feelings he utters are too deep to be realised by more
than two at a time—one who plays and one who listens, till their
souls dance together in an ecstatic embrace of Mutual Sympathy.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>THE DANCE OF LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>It is at Vienna, which has more feminine grace and beauty to
the square mile than any other city in the world, that the art of
dancing is to be seen in its greatest perfection. No wonder that
it is the home of the Waltz-King, Johann Strauss; and that a
Viennese feuilletonist has shown the deepest insight into the
psychology of the dance in an article from which the following
excerpts are taken:—</p>

<p class='c001'>"The waltz has a creative, a rejuvenating power, which no
other dance possesses. The skipping polka is characterised by a
certain stiffness and angularity, a rhythm rather sober and old-fashioned.
The galop is a wild hurricane, which moves along
rudely and threatens to blow over everything that comes in its
way; it is the most brutal of all dances, an enemy of all tender
and refined feelings, a bacchanalian rushing up and down....</p>

<p class='c001'>"The waltz, therefore, remains as the only true and real dance.
Waltzing is not walking, skipping, jumping, rushing, raving; it is
a gentle floating and flying; from the heaviest men it seems to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>take away some of their materiality, to raise the most massive
women from the ground into the air. True, the Viennese alone
know how to dance it, as they alone know how to play it....</p>

<p class='c001'>“The waltz insists on a personal monopoly, on being loved for
its own sake, and permits no vapid side-remarks regarding the fine
weather, the hot room, the toilets of the ladies; the couple glide
along hardly speaking a word; except that she may beg for a
pause, or he, indefatigable, insatiable, intoxicated by the music
and motion, the fragrance of flowers and ladies, invites her to a
new flight around the hall. And yet is this mute dance the most
eloquent, the most expressive and emotional, the most sensuous
that could be imagined; and if the dancer has anything to say to
his partner, let him mutely confide it to her in the sweet whirl
of a waltz, for then the music is his advocate, then every bar
pleads for him, every note is a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>billet-doux</i></span>, every breath a declaration
of love. Jealous husbands do not allow their wives to waltz
with another man. They are right, for the waltz is the Dance of
Love.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>BALLET-DANCING</h3>

<p class='c013'>There is one more form of dancing which may be briefly alluded
to, because it illustrates the hypocrisy of the average mortal as
well as the rarity of true æsthetic taste. Solo ballet-dancing is
admired not only by the bald-headed old men in the parquet, but
there are critics who seriously discuss such dancing as if it were a
fine art; generally lamenting the good old times of the great and
graceful ballet-dancers. The truth is that ballet-dancing <em>never
can be graceful</em>, as now practised. To secure graceful movement
it is absolutely necessary to make use of the elasticity of the toes—to
touch the ground at the place where the toes articulate with
the middle foot, and to give the last push with the yielding great
toe. Ballet-dancers, however, walk on the tips of their stiffened
toes, the result of which is, as the anatomist, Professor Kollmann,
remarks, that “their gait is deprived of all elasticity and becomes
stiff, as in going on stilts.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It speaks well for the growing sensibility of mankind that this
form of dancing is gradually losing favour. Like the vocal tight-rope
dancing of the operatic <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>prime donne</i></span> with whom ballet-dancers
are associated, their art is a mere circus-trick, gaped at
as a difficult <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>tour de force</i></span>, but appealing in no sense to æsthetic
sentiments.</p>

<p class='c001'>These strictures, of course, apply merely to solo-dancing on
tiptoe. The spectacular ballet, which delights the eye with kaleidoscopic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>colours and groupings, is quite another thing, and may be
made highly artistic.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE LOWER LIMBS</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>MUSCULAR DEVELOPMENT</h3>

<p class='c013'>The assumption by man of an erect attitude has modified and
improved the appearance of his leg and thigh quite as marvellously
as his feet. “In walking,” says Professor Kollmann, “the weight
of the body is alternately transferred from one foot to the other.
Each one is obliged in locomotion to take its turn in supporting
the whole body, which explains the great size of the muscles which
make up man’s calf. The ape’s calf is smaller for the reason that
these animals commonly go on all fours.” Professor Carl Vogt
gives these details: “No ape has such a cylindrical, <em>gradually
diminishing</em> thigh; and we are justified in saying that man alone
possesses thighs. The muscles of the leg are in man so accumulated
as to form a calf, while in the ape they are more equally distributed;
still, transitions are not wanting, since one of the greatest
characteristics of the negro consists in his calfless leg.” And
again: “Man possesses, as contrasted with the ape, a distinctive
character in the strength, <em>rotundity</em>, and length of the lower limb;
especially in the thighs, which in most animals are shortened in
proportion to the leg.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The words here italicised call attention to two of the qualities
of Beauty—gradation and the curve of rotundity—which the lower
limbs in their evolution are thus seen to be gradually approximating.
Other improvements are seen in the greater smoothness, the
more graceful and expressive gait resulting from the rounded but
straight knee, etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>The implication that savages are in the muscular development
of their limbs intermediate between apes and civilised men calls
for further testimony and explanation. Waitz states that “in
regard to muscular power Indians are commonly inferior to
Europeans”; and Mr. Herbert Spencer has collected much evidence
of a similar nature. The Ostyaks have “thin and slender
legs”; the Kamtchadales “short and slender legs”; those of the
Chinooks are “small and crooked”; and the African Akka have
“short and bandy legs.” The legs of Australians are “inferior in
mass of muscle”; the gigantic Patagonians have limbs “neither
so muscular nor so large-boned as their height and apparent bulk
would induce one to suppose.” Spencer likewise calls attention to
the fact that relatively-inferior legs are “a trait which, remotely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>simian, is also repeated by the child of the civilised man”—which
thus individually passes through the several stages of development
that have successively characterised its ancestors.</p>

<p class='c001'>Numerous exceptions are of course to be found to the rule that
the muscular rotundity and plumpness of the limbs increases with
civilisation. The lank shins which may be seen by the hundred
among the bathers at our sea-coast resorts contrast disadvantageously
with many photographs of savages; and tourists in Africa
and among South American Indians and elsewhere have often
enough noted the occurrence of individuals and tribes who would
have furnished admirable models for sculptors. But this only
proves, on the one hand, that “civilised” persons who are uncivilised
in their neglect of the laws of Health, inevitably lose certain
traits of Beauty which exercise alone can give; while, on the other
hand, those “savages” who lead an active and healthy life are <em>in
so far</em> civilised, and therefore enjoy the superior attractions bestowed
by civilisation. Moreover, as Mr. Spencer suggests, “In combat,
the power exercised by arm and trunk is limited by the power of
the legs to withstand the strain thrown on them. Hence, apart
from advantages in locomotion, the stronger-legged nations have
tended to become, other things equal, dominant races.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Rengger,” says Darwin, “attributes the thin legs and thick
arms of the Payaguas Indians to successive generations having
passed nearly their whole lives in canoes, with their lower extremities
motionless. Other writers have come to a similar conclusion
in analogous cases.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Although savages have to hunt for a living and occasionally go
to war, they are essentially a lazy crew, taking no more exercise
than necessary; which accounts for the fact that, with the exceptions
noted, their muscular development is inferior to that of higher
races.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>BEAUTIFYING EXERCISE</h3>

<p class='c013'>One of the most discouraging aspects of modern life is the
growing tendency toward concentration of the population in large
cities. Not only is the air less salubrious in cities than in the
country, but the numerous cheap facilities for riding discourage the
habit of walking. London is one of the healthiest cities, and the
English the most vigorous race, in the world; yet it is said that it
is difficult to trace a London family down through five generations.
Few Paris families can, it is said, be traced even through three
generations. Without constant rural accessions cities would tend
to become depopulated.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>The enormous importance of exercise for Health and Beauty,
which are impossible without it, is vividly brought out in this
statement of Kollmann’s: “Muscles which are thoroughly exercised
do not only retain their strength, but increase in circumference
and power, in man as in animals. The flesh is then firm, and
coloured intensely red. In a paralysed arm the muscles are
degenerated, and have lost a portion of one of their most important
constituents—albumen. Repeated contractions strengthen a muscle,
because motion accelerates the circulation of the blood and the
nutrition of the tissues. What a great influence this has on the
whole body may be inferred from the fact that the organs of
locomotion—the skeleton and muscles—make up more than 82
per cent of the substance of the body. With this enormous proportion
of bone and muscle, it is obvious that exercise is essential
to bodily health.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Exercise in a gymnasium is useful but monotonous; and too
often the benefits are neutralised by the insufficient provision for
fresh air, without which exercise is worse than useless. Hence the
superiority of open-air games—base-ball, tennis, rowing, riding,
swimming, etc., to the addiction to which the English owe so much
of their superior physique. Tourists in Canada invariably notice
the wonderful figures of the women, which they owe largely to
their fondness for skating. “Beyond question,” says the <cite>Lancet</cite>,
“skating is one of the finest sports, especially for ladies. It is
graceful, healthy, stimulating to the muscles, and it develops in a
very high degree the important faculty of balancing the body and
preserving perfect control over the whole of the muscular system,
while bringing certain muscles into action at will. Moreover, there
is this about it which is of especial value: it trains by exercise the
power of intentionally inducing and maintaining a continuous contraction
of the muscles of the lower extremity. The joints, hip,
knee, and ankle are firmly fixed or rather kept steadily under
control, while the limbs are so set by their muscular apparatus
that they form, as it were, part of the skate that glides over the
smooth surface. To skate well and gracefully is a very high
accomplishment indeed, and perhaps one of the very best exercises
in which young women and girls can engage with a view to healthful
development.”</p>

<p class='c001'>For the acquisition of a graceful gait women need such exercise
more even than men; and while engaged in it they should pay
especial attention to exercising the left side of the body. On this
point Sir Charles Bell has made the following suggestive remarks:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“We see that opera-dancers execute their more difficult feats
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>on the right foot, but their preparatory exercises better evince the
natural weakness of the left limb; in order to avoid awkwardness
in the public exhibitions, they are obliged to give double practice
to the left leg; and if they neglect to do so an ungraceful preference
to the right side will be remarked. In walking behind a
person we seldom see an equalised motion of the body; the tread
is not so firm upon the left foot, the toe is not so much turned out,
and a greater push is made with the right. From the peculiar
form of woman, and from the elasticity of her step, resulting from
the motion of the ankle rather than of the haunches, the defect of
the left foot, when it exists, is more apparent in her gait.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Those who wish to acquire a graceful gait will find several
useful hints in this extract from Professor Kollmann’s <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Plastische
Anatomie</cite></span>, p. 506:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Human gait, it is well known, is subject to individual variations.
Differences are to be noted not only in rapidity of motion,
but as regards the position of the trunk and the movements of the
limbs, within certain limits. For instance, the gait of very fat
persons is somewhat vacillating; other persons acquire a certain
dignity of gait by bending and stretching their limbs as little as
possible while taking long steps; and others still bend their knees
very much, which gives a slovenly character to their gait. And
as regards the attitude of the trunk, a different effect is given
according as it is inclined backwards or forwards, or executes
superfluous movements in the same direction or to the sides. All
these peculiarities make an impression on our eyes, while our ears
are impressed at the same time by the differences in rapidity of
movement, so that we learn to recognise our friends by the sound
of their walk as we do by the quality of their voice.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bell states that “upwards of fifty muscles of the arm and
hand may be demonstrated, which must all consent to the
simplest action.” Walking is a no less complicated affair, to
which the attention of men of science has been only quite recently
directed. The new process of instantaneous photography has
been found very useful, but much remains to be done before the
mystery of a graceful gait can be considered solved. If some
skilled photographer would go to Spain and take a number of
instantaneous pictures of Andalusian girls, the most graceful
beings in the world, in every variety of attitude and motion, he
might render most valuable service to the cause of personal
æsthetics.</p>

<p class='c001'>The time will come, no doubt, when dancing masters and
mistresses will consider the teaching of the waltz and the lancers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>only the crudest and easiest part of their work, and when they
will have advanced classes who will be instructed in the refinements
of movement as carefully and as intelligently as professors
of music teach their pupils the proper use of the parts and muscles
of the hand, to attain a delicate and varied touch. The majority
of women might make much more progress in the art of gracefulness
than they ever will in music; and is not the poetry of
motion as noble and desirable an object of study as any other
fine art?</p>

<h3 class='c014'>FASHIONABLE UGLINESS</h3>

<p class='c013'>It is the essence of fashion to exaggerate everything to the
point of ugliness. Instead of trying to remedy the disadvantages
to their gait resulting from anatomical peculiarities (just referred
to in a quotation from Bell), women frequently take pains to
deliberately exaggerate them. As Alexander Walker remarks:
“The largeness of the pelvis and the approximation of the knees
influence the gait of woman, and render it vacillating and unsteady.
Conscious of this, women, in countries where the nutritive system
in general and the pelvis in particular are large, affect a greater
degree of this vacillating unsteadiness. An example of this is
seen in the lateral and rotatory motion which is given to the
pelvis in walking by certain classes of the women in London.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Egyptians and Arabians consider this ludicrous rotatory
motion a great fascination, and have a special name for it—Ghung.</p>

<p class='c001'>But Fashion, the handmaid of ugliness, is not content with
aping the bad taste of Arabians and Egyptians. It goes several
steps lower than that, down to the Hottentots. The latest hideous
craze of Fashion, against which not one woman in a hundred
had taste or courage enough to revolt—the bustle or “dress-improver” (!)—was
simply the milliner’s substitute for an anatomical
peculiarity natural to some African savages.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is well known,” says Darwin, “that with many Hottentot
women the posterior part of the body projects in a wonderful
manner; they are steatopygous; and Sir Andrew Smith is certain
that this peculiarity is greatly admired by the men. He once
saw a woman who was considered a beauty, and she was so
immensely developed behind, that when seated on level ground
she could not rise, and had to push herself along until she came to
a slope. Some of the women in various negro tribes have the
same peculiarity; and, according to Burton, the Somal men ‘are
said to choose their wives by ranging them in a line, and by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>picking her out who projects farthest <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>a tergo</i></span>. Nothing can be
more hateful to a negro than the opposite form.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>Evidently “civilised” and savage women do not differ as
regards Fashion, the handmaid of ugliness. But the men do.
While the male Hottentots admire the natural steatopyga of their
women, civilised men, without exception, detest the artificial
imitation of it, which makes a woman look and walk like a
deformed dromedary.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>THE CRINOLINE CRAZE</h3>

<p class='c013'>The bustle is not only objectionable in itself as a hideous
deformity and a revival of Hottentot taste, but still more as a
probable forerunner of that most unutterably vulgar article of
dress ever invented by Fashion—the crinoline. For we read that
when, in 1856, the crinoline came in again, it was preceded by
the “inelegant bustle in the upper part of the skirt”; and it is a
notorious fact that cunning milliners are making strenuous efforts
every year to reintroduce the crinoline.</p>

<p class='c001'>In their abhorrence of the crinoline men do not stand alone.
There are several refined women to-day who would absolutely
refuse to submit to the tyranny of Fashion if it should again
prescribe the crinoline. One of these is evidently Mrs. Haweis,
who in <cite>The Art of Beauty</cite> remarks that “The crinoline superseded
all our <em>attention to posture</em>; whilst our long trains, which can
hardly look inelegant [?] even on clumsy persons, make small
ankles or thick ones a matter of little moment. We have become
inexpressibly slovenly. We no longer study how to walk, perhaps
the most difficult of all actions to do gracefully. Our fashionable
women stride and loll in open defiance of elegance,” etc. And
again: “This gown in outline simply looks <em>like a very ill-shaped
wine-glass upside down</em>. The wide crinoline entirely <em>conceals
every natural grace of attitude</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Another lady, writing in the <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite> (1859), remarks
concerning the crinoline: “A woman in this rig hangs in her
skirts <em>like a clapper in a bell</em>; and I never meet one without
being tempted to take her by the neck and ring her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>About 1710, says a writer in the <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>,
“as if resolved that their figures should rival their heads in
extravagance, they introduced the hooped petticoat, at first worn
in such a manner as to give to the person of the wearer below her
very tightly-laced waist a contour <em>resembling the letter V inverted</em>—<span class='large'>ʌ</span>.
The hooped dresses, thus introduced, about 1740 attained
to an enormous expansion; and being worn at their full circumference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>immediately below the waist, they in many ways emulated
the most outrageous of the fardingales of the Elizabethan period.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“About 1744 hoops are mentioned as so extravagant,” says
Chambers’s <cite>Encyclopædia</cite>, “that <em>a woman occupied the space of
six men</em>.” George IV. had the good taste to abolish them by
royal command, but they were revived in 1856. The newspapers
of two decades ago daily contained accounts of accidents due to
the idiotic crinoline. “The <cite>Spectator</cite> dealt out much cutting,
though playful, raillery at the hoops of his day, but apparently
with little effect; and equally unavailing are the satires of <cite>Punch</cite>
and other caricaturists of the present time against the hideous
fashion of crinoline.... Owing to its prevalence, church-pews
that formerly held seven are now let for six, and yet feel rather
crowded. The hoops are sometimes made with a <em>circumference of
four or even five yards</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is universally admitted that the human form, in its perfection,
is Nature’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>chef d’&oelig;uvre</i></span>—the most finished specimen of her
workmanship. Yet the accounts of savage taste given by travellers
and anthropologists show that the savage is never satisfied with
the human outlines as God made them, but constantly mars and
mutilates them by altering the shape of the head, piercing the
nose, filing or colouring the teeth, enlarging the lips to enormous
dimensions, favouring an adipose bustle, etc. This is precisely
what modern Fashion, the handmaid of ugliness, does. We have
just seen how fashionable women, unable to comprehend the
beauty of the human form, have for several generations endeavoured
to give it the shape of “a very ill-shaped wine-glass,
upside down,” “a clapper in a bell,” or “the letter V inverted.”
And concerning Queen Elizabeth the <cite>Atlantic</cite> writer already
quoted says very pithily: “What with stomachers and pointed
waist and fardingale, and sticking in here and sticking out there,
and ruffs and cuffs, and ouches and jewels and puckers, she looks
<em>like a hideous flying insect</em> with expanded wings, seen through a
microscope—not at all like a woman.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Fortunately, for the moment, the crinoline, like the fardingale,
is not “in fashion.” But, as already stated, there is considerable
danger of a new invasion every year; and, should Fashion proclaim
its edict, no doubt the vast majority of women would follow,
as they did a decade or two ago. In the interest of good taste,
as of common sense, it is therefore necessary to speak with brutal
frankness on this subject. There is good evidence to show that
the crinoline originated in the desire of an aristocratic dame of
low moral principles to conceal the evidences of a crime. Hence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>the original French name for the crinoline—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Cache-Bâtard</i></span>. Will
respectable and refined women consent once more to have the
fashion set for them by a courtesan?</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE WAIST</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>THE BEAUTY CURVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>In a well-shaped waist, as in every other part of the body, the
curved line of Beauty, with its delicate gradations, exercises a
great charm. Examination of a Greek statue of the best period,
male or female, or of the goddess of beauty in the Pagoda at
Bangalur, India, shows a slight inward curve at the waist, whereas
in early Greek and Egyptian art this curve is absent. The waist,
therefore, like the feet and limbs, appears to have been gradually
moulded into accordance with the line of Beauty—a notion which
is also supported by the following remarks in Tylor’s <cite>Anthropology</cite>:
“If fairly chosen photographs of Kaffirs be compared with a
classic model such as the Apollo, it will be noticed that the trunk
of the African has a somewhat wall-sided straightness, wanting in
the inward slope which gives fineness to the waist, and in the
expansion below, which gives breadth across the hips, these being
two of the most noticeable points in the classic model which our
painters recognise as an ideal of manly beauty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In woman, owing to the greater dimensions of her pelvis, this
curvature is more pronounced than in man; yet even in woman it
must be slight if the laws of Health and Beauty are to suffer no
violation. “<em>Moderation</em>” is the one word which Mr. Buskin says
he would have inscribed in golden letters over the door of every
school of art. For “the least appearance of violence or extravagance,
of the want of moderation and restraint, is,” as he remarks,
“destructive of all beauty whatsoever in everything—colour, form,
motion, language, or thought—giving rise to that which in colour
we call glaring, in form inelegant, in motion ungraceful, in language
coarse, in thought undisciplined, in all unchastened; which qualities
are in everything most painful, because the signs of disobedient
and irregular operation. And herein we at last find the reason of
that which has been so often noted respecting the subtility and
almost invisibility of natural curves and colours, and why it is that
we look on those lines as least beautiful which fall into wide and
far license of curvature, and as most beautiful which approach
nearest (so that the curvilinear character be distinctly asserted) to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>the government of the right line, as in the pure and severe curves
of the draperies of the religious painters,” etc.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>THE WASP-WAIST MANIA</h3>

<p class='c013'>But Fashion, the handmaid of ugliness, too vulgar to appreciate
the exquisite beauty of slight and subtle curvature, makes woman’s
waist the most maltreated and deformed part of her body. There
is not one woman in a hundred who does not deliberately destroy
twenty per cent of her Personal Beauty by the way in which she
reduces the natural dimensions of her waist. There is, indeed,
ground to believe that the main reason why the bustle, and even
the crinoline, are not looked on with abhorrence by all women is
because they aid the corset in making the waist look smaller by
contrast. The Wasp-waist Mania is therefore the disease which
most imperatively calls for cure. But the task seems almost
hopeless; for, as a female writer remarks, it is almost as difficult
to cure a woman of the corset habit as a man of intemperance in
drink.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The injurious custom of tight lacing,” says Planché in his
<cite>Cyclopædia of Costumes</cite>, “‘a custom fertile in disease and death,’
appears to have been introduced by the Normans as early as the
twelfth century; and the romances of the Middle Ages teem with
allusions to and laudations of the wasplike waists of the dames
and demoiselles of the period.... Chaucer, describing the carpenter’s
wife, says her body was ‘gentyll and small as a weasel’;
and the depraved taste extended to Scotland. Dunbar, in <cite>The
Thistle and the Rose</cite>, describing some beautiful women, observes—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Their middles were as small as wands.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>And to make their middles as small as possible has been ever
since an unfortunate mania with the generality of the fair sex, to
the detriment of their health and the distortion of their forms.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ever since 1602, when Felix Plater raised his voice against the
corset, physicians have written against tight lacing. But not only
has it been found impossible to cure this mania, even its causes
have remained a mystery to the present day. Certainly no man
can understand the problem. Is it simply the average woman’s
lack of taste that urges her thus to mutilate her Personal Beauty?
Is it the admiration of a few vulgar “mashers” and barber’s pets—since
educated men detest wasp-waists? Or is it simply the
proverbial feminine craze for emulating one another and arousing
envy by excelling in some extravagance of dress, no matter at what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>cost? This last suggestion is probably the true solution of the
problem. The only satisfaction a woman can get from having a
wasp-waist is the envy of other silly women. What a glorious
recompense for her æsthetic suicide, her invalidism, and her humiliating
confession that she considers the natural shape of God’s
masterwork—the female body—inferior in beauty to the contours
of the lowly wasp!</p>

<p class='c001'>With this ignoble pleasure derived from the envy of silly women
and the admiration of vulgar men, compare a few of the disadvantages
resulting from tight lacing. They are of two kinds—hygienic
and æsthetic.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Hygienic Disadvantages.</em>—Surely no woman can look without a
shudder at a fashionable Parisian figure placed side by side with
the Venus of Milo in Professor Flower’s <cite>Fashion in Deformity</cite>, in
Mrs. Haweis’s <cite>Art of Beauty</cite>, or in Behnke and Brown’s <cite>Voice,
Song, and Speech</cite>; or look without horror at the skeletons showing
the excessive compression of the lower ribs brought about by
fashionable lacing, and the injurious displacement, in consequence,
of some of the most important vital organs. Nor can any young
man who does not desire to marry a foredoomed invalid, and raise
sickly children, fail to be cured for ever of his love for any wasp-waisted
girl if he will take the trouble to read the account of the
terrible female maladies resulting from lacing, given in Dr. Gaillard
Thomas’s famous treatise on the <cite>Diseases of Women</cite>, in the chapter
on “Improprieties in Dress.” To cite only one sentence: Women,
he says, subject their waist to a “constriction which, in autopsy,
will sometimes be found to have <em>left the impress of the ribs upon
the liver, producing depressions corresponding to them</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Says Dr. J. J. Pope: “The German physiologist, Sömmering,
has enumerated no fewer than <em>ninety-two diseases</em> resulting from
tight lacing.... ‘But I do not lace tightly,’ every lady is ready
to answer. No woman ever did, if we accept her own statement.
Yet stay. Why does your corset unclasp with a snap? <em>And why
do you involuntarily take a deep breath directly it is loosened?</em>”
Young ladies who imagine they do not wear too tight stays, inasmuch
as they can still insert their hand, will find the fallacy and
danger of this reasoning exposed in Mr. B. Roth’s <cite>Dress: its
Sanitary Aspect</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The last line which I have italicised is of extreme significance.
Perhaps the greatest of all evils resulting from tight lacing is that it
discourages or <em>prevents deep breathing</em>, which is so absolutely essential
to the maintenance of health and beauty. The “heaving
bosom” of a maiden may be a fine poetic expression, but it indicates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>that the maiden wears stays and breathes at the wrong (upper)
end of her lungs. “The fact of a patient breathing in this manner
is noted by a physician as a grave symptom, because it indicates
mischief of a vital nature in lungs, heart, or other important organ.”
Healthy breathing should be chiefly costal or abdominal; but this
is made impossible by the corset, which compresses the lower ribs,
till, instead of being widely apart below, they meet in the middle,
and thus prevent the lungs from expanding and receiving the
normal share of oxygen, the only true elixir of life, youth, and
beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'>This wrong breathing, due to tight lacing, also causes “congestion
of the vessels of the neck and throat ... gasping, jerking,
and fatigue in inspiration, and unevenness, trembling, and undue
vibration in the production and emission of vocal tone.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Further, as the <cite>Lancet</cite> points out, “tight stays are a common
cause of so-called ‘weak’ spine, due to weakness of muscles of the
back.” Lacing prevents the abdominal muscles from exercising
their natural functions—alternate relaxation and contraction: “A
tight-laced pair of stays acts precisely as a splint to the trunk, and
prevents or greatly impedes the action of the chief back muscles,
which therefore become weakened. The unfortunate wearer feels
her spine weaken, thinks she wants more support, so laces herself
still tighter; she no doubt does get some support in this way, but
at what a terrible cost!”</p>

<p class='c001'>In regard to tight corsets, as another physician has aptly remarked,
women are like the victims of the opium habit, who also
daily feel the need of a larger dose of their stimulant, every increment
of which adds a year to their age, and brings them a few
steps nearer disease and ugly decrepitude.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Æsthetic Disadvantages.</em>—Among the æsthetic disadvantages
resulting from the Wasp-waist Mania, the following may be mentioned,
besides the loss of a clear, mellow, musical voice already
referred to:—</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) A stiff, inflexible waist, with a coarsely exaggerated contour,
in place of the slight and subtle curvature so becoming to woman.
In other words, a violation of the first law of personal æsthetics—imposing
the shape of a vulgar garment on the human form, instead
of making the dress follow the outlines of the body.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) A sickly, sallow complexion, pale lips, a red nose, lack of
buoyancy, general feebleness, lassitude, apathy, and stupidity,
resulting from the fact that the compression of the waist induces
an oxygen-famine. The eyes lose their sparkle and love-inspiring
magic, the features are perceptibly distorted, the brow is prematurely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>wrinkled, and the expression and temper are soured by the
constant discomfort that has to be silently endured.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) Ugly shoulders. A woman’s shoulders should be sloping
and well rounded, like every other part of her body. Regarding
the common feminine deformity of square shoulders, Drs. Brinton
and Napheys remark, in their work on <cite>Personal Beauty</cite>, that “in
four cases out of five it has been brought about by too close-fitting
corsets, which press the shoulder-blades behind, and collar-bones in
front, too far upwards, and thus ruin the appearance of the
shoulders.”</p>

<p class='c001'>(4) An ugly bust. Tight lacing “flattens and displaces the
breasts.”</p>

<p class='c001'>(5) Clumsiness. The corset is ruinous to grace. “Almost
daily,” says Dr. Alice B. Stockham (<cite>Tokology</cite>), “women come to
my office [in Chicago] burdened with bands and heavy clothing,
every vital organ restricted by dress. It is not unusual to count
from <em>sixteen to eighteen thicknesses of cloth</em> worn tightly about the
pliable structure of the waist.” And Dr. Lennox Browne advances
the following crushing <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>argumentum ad feminam</i></span>:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is impossible for the stiffly-corseted girl to be other than
inelegant and ungraceful in her movements. Her imprisoned
waist, with its flabby muscles, has no chance of performing beautiful
undulatory movements. In the ballroom the ungraceful motions
of our stiff-figured ladies are bad enough; there is no possibility for
poetry of motion; but nowhere is this more ludicrously and, to the
thoughtful, painfully manifest than in the tennis court. Let any
one watch the movements of ladies as compared with those of male
players, and the absolute ugliness of the female figure, with its
stiff, unyielding, deformed, round waist, will at once be seen.
Ladies can only bend the body from the hip-joint. All that wonderfully
contrived set of hinges, with their connected muscles, in
the elastic column of the spine, is unable to act from the shoulders
downwards; and their figures remind one of the old-fashioned
modern Dutch doll.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CORPULENCE AND LEANNESS</h3>

<p class='c013'>Many women consider the corset necessary as a figure-improver,
especially if they suffer from excessive fatness. They will be surprised
to hear that the corset is one of the principal causes of their
corpulence. Says Professor M. Williams: “There is one horror
which no lady can bear to contemplate, viz. fat. What is fat?
It is an accumulation of unburnt body-fuse. How can we get rid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>of it when accumulated in excess? Simply by burning it away—this
burning being done by means of the oxygen inhaled by the
lungs. If, as Mr. Lennox Browne has shown, a lady with normal
lung capacity of 125 cubic inches, reduces this to 78 inches by
means of her stays, and attains 118 inches all at once on leaving
them off, it is certain that her prospects of becoming fat and flabby
as she advances towards middle age are greatly increased by tight
lacing, and the consequent suppression of natural respiration.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus corpulence may be put down as a sixth—or rather
seventh—æsthetic disadvantage resulting from the use of
corsets.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reason why women, although inferior to men in muscular
development, have softer and rounder forms, is because there is a
greater natural tendency in women than in men towards the accumulation
of fatty tissue under the skin. The least excess of this
adipose tissue is, however, as fatal as emaciation to that admiration
of Personal Beauty which constitutes the essence of Love. Leanness
repels the æsthetico-amorous sense because it obliterates the
round contours of beauty, exposes the sinews and bones, and thus
suggests old age and disease. Corpulence repels it because it
destroys all delicacy of form, all grace of movement, and in its
exaggerated forms may indeed be looked upon as a real disease
imperatively calling for medical treatment; as Dr. Oscar Maas
shows most clearly and concisely in his pamphlet on the “Schwenninger
Cure,” which should be read by all who suffer from obesity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although the very “father of medicine,” Hippokrates, studied
the subject of corpulence, and formulated rules for curing it, doctors
still disagree regarding some of the details of its treatment. Some
forbid all fatty food, others prescribe it in small quantities, and Dr.
Ebstein specially recommends fat viands and sauces as preventives;
but the preponderance of the best medical opinion is against him.
Dr. Say recommends the drinking of very large quantities of tea,
while Professor Oertel urges the diminution of fluids in the body,
first by drinking little, and secondly by inducing copious perspiration,
either artificially (by hot air and steam baths, etc.), or, what
is much better, by brisk daily exercise. Dr. Schwenninger, who
secured so much fame by reducing Bismarck’s weight about 40
pounds, forbids the taking of liquids during or within an hour or
two of meal-time; in other words, he counsels his patients not to
eat and drink at the same time.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the two most important points all authorities are practically
agreed. They are that the patient must avoid food which contains
large quantities of starch and sugar (such as cake, pastry, potatoes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>bread, pudding, honey, syrup, etc.); and secondly, that he must take
as much exercise as possible in the open air, because during walking
the bodily fat is consumed as fuel, to keep the machine going.</p>

<p class='c001'>The notorious Mr. Banting, who reduced his weight in a year
from 202 to 150 pounds, “lived on beef, mutton, fish, bacon, dry
toast and biscuit, poultry, game, tea, coffee, claret, and sherry in
small quantities, and a night-cap of gin, whisky, brandy, or wine.
He <em>abstained</em> from the following articles: pork, veal, salmon, eels,
herrings, sugar, milk, and all sorts of vegetables grown underground,
and nearly all fatty and farinaceous substances. He daily
drank 43 ounces of liquids. On this diet he kept himself for seven
years at 150 pounds. He found, what other experience confirms,
that <em>sugar was the most powerful of all fatteners</em>” (Dr. G. M.
Beard, in <cite>Eating and Drinking</cite>, a most entertaining and useful
little volume).</p>

<p class='c001'>Lean persons wishing to increase their weight need only reverse
the directions here given as regards the choice or avoidance of
certain articles of food. Not so, however, with regard to exercise.
If you wish to reduce your corpulence, take exercise; if you wish
to increase your weight, again take exercise. The apparent paradox
lurking in this rule is easily explained. If you are too fat and
walk a great deal, you burn up the superfluous <em>fat</em> and lose weight.
If you are too lean and walk a great deal you increase the bulk of
your <em>muscles</em>, and thus gain weight. Moreover, you greatly stimulate
your appetite, and become able to eat larger quantities of
sweet and starchy food—more than enough to counteract the wear
and tear caused by the exercise.</p>

<p class='c001'>Muscle is the plastic material of beauty. Fat should only be
present in sufficient quantity to prevent the irregular outlines of
the muscles from being too conspicuously indicated, at the expense
of rounded smoothness. What the ancient Greeks thought on this
subject is vividly shown in the following remarks by Dr. Maas:
“According to the unanimous testimony of Thukydides, Plato,
Xenophon, the gymnastic exercises to which the Greeks were so
passionately addicted, and which constituted, as is well known, a
very essential part of the public education of the young, had for
their avowed object the prevention of undue corpulence, since an
excessive paunch did not only offend the highly-developed æsthetic
sense of this talented nation, but was justly regarded as an impediment
to bodily activity. In order, therefore, to make the youths
not only beautiful, but also vigorous and able to resist hardship,
and thus more capable of serving their country, they were, from
their childhood, and uninterruptedly, exercised daily in running,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>wrestling, throwing the discus, etc.; so that the prevention of corpulence
was practically raised to a formal state-maxim, and as such
enforced occasionally with unyielding persistence.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The ruinous consequences of an exaggerated abdomen to the
harmonious proportions of the body, and to grace of attitude and
gait, are so universally known that it would be superfluous to
apply any of our negative tests of Beauty—such as the facts that
apes and savages are commonly characterised by protuberant
bellies, and that intemperance and gluttony have the same disastrous
effect on Personal Beauty. In civilised communities, indolence
and beer-drinking are the chief causes predisposing to corpulence.
In Bavaria, where enormous quantities of beer are consumed,
almost all the men are deformed by obesity; but in other countries,
as a rule, women suffer more from this anomaly than men,
because they lead a less active life.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may be stated as a general rule that girls under eighteen are
too slight and women over thirty too heavy—"fat and forty."
This calamity is commonly looked on as one of the inevitable
dispensations of Providence, whereas it is simply a result of
indolence and ignorance. With a little care in dieting, and two or
three hours a day devoted to walking, rowing, tennis, swimming,
dancing, etc., any young lady can add ten to fifteen pounds to her
weight in one summer, or reduce it by that amount, as may be
desired. But as the consumption of enormous quantities of fresh
air by the unimprisoned lungs is the absolute condition of success
in this beautifying process, it is useless to attempt it without
laying aside the corset.</p>

<p class='c001'>The plea that corsets are needed to hold up the heavy clothing
is of no moment. Women, like men, should wear their clothing
suspended from the shoulder, which is a great deal more conducive
to health, comfort, and gracefulness than the clumsy fashion of
attaching everything to the waist.</p>

<p class='c001'>Still less weight can be attached to the monstrous argument
that women need stays for support. What an insulting proposition
to assert that civilised woman is so imperfectly constructed
that she alone of all created beings needs artificial surgical support
to keep her body in position! If there are any women so very
corpulent or so very lean that they need a corset as a figure-improver
or a support, then let them have it for heaven’s sake, and
look upon themselves as subjects ripe for medical treatment.
What is objected to here is that strong, healthy, well-shaped girls
should deform themselves deliberately by wearing tight, unshapely
corsets, rankly offensive to the æsthetic sense.</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>THE FASHION FETISH ANALYSED</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Once more the question must be asked, “Why do women wear
such hideous things as crinolines, bustles, and corsets, so universally
abhorred by men?” Is it because they are inferior to men
in æsthetic taste? Is Schopenhauer right when he says that
“women are and remain, on the whole, the most absolute and incurable
Philistines?” They are deficient in objectivity, he adds:
“hence they have no real intelligence or appreciation for music or
poetry, or the plastic arts; and if they make any pretences of
this sort, it is only apish affectation to gratify their vanity. Hence
it would be more correct to call them the <em>unæsthetic</em> than the
beautiful sex.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The pessimistic woman-hater no doubt exaggerates. Yet—without
alluding to the paucity of women who have distinguished
themselves in the fine arts—is it credible that the average woman
would so readily submit to a repulsive fashion like the bustle, or a
hat “adorned” with the corpse of a murdered bird, if she had
even a trace of æsthetic feeling? If women had the refined
æsthetic taste with which they are commonly credited, is it conceivable
that they would voluntarily adopt the African bustle,
because fashionable, in preference to a more becoming style?
Have you ever heard that a person of acknowledged musical taste,
for example, gave up his violin or piano to learn the African
banjo, because that happened to be the fashionable instrument?</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet there are, no doubt, many women whose eyes even custom
cannot blind to the hideousness of most Parisian fashions. But
they have not the courage to show their superior taste in their
dresses, being overawed and paralysed in presence of a monstrous
idol, the Fashion Fetish.</p>

<p class='c001'>Never has a stone image, consecrated by cunning priests, exercised
a more magic influence on a superstitious heathen’s mind
than the invisible Fashion Fetish on the modern feminine intellect.
It is both amusing and pathetic to hear a woman exclaim: “Our
women are most blind and thoughtless followers of fashions still
imposed upon them, <em>Heaven knows wherefore and by whom</em>” (Mrs.
Haweis).</p>

<p class='c001'>So great is the awe in which this Fetish is held that no one
has yet dared to lay violent hands on it. Yet if we now knock it
on the head, we shall find it hollow inside; and the fragments,
subjected to chemical analysis, show that they consist of the
following five elements:—</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>(1) <em>Vulgar Display of Wealth.</em>—A certain number of rich
people, being unable to distinguish themselves from poorer mortals
in any other way, make a parade of their money by constantly
introducing changes in the fashion of their apparel which those
who have less income are unable to adopt at once. This, and not
the love of novelty, is the real cause of the minute variations in
styles constantly introduced. Of course it is generally understood
that to boast of your wealth is as vulgar as to boast of your wit
or wisdom; but this makes no difference, for Fashion in its very
essence is vulgar.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) <em>Milliners’ Cunning.</em>—Milliners grow fat on fashionable
extravagance. Hence it is the one object of their life to encourage
this extravagance. So they constantly invent new styles, to
prevent women from wearing the same dress more than one
season. And every customer is slyly flattered into the belief that
nothing was ever so becoming to her as the latest style, though it
probably makes her look like a fright. As a little flattery goes a
great way with most women, the milliner’s hypocrisy escapes detection.
“The persons who devise fashions are not artists in
the best sense of the word, nor are they persons of culture or
taste,” as Mr. E. L. Godkin remarks: “their business is not to
provide beautiful costumes but new ones.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is to such scheming and unscrupulous artisans that women
entrust the care of their personal appearance. And they will continue
doing so until they are more generally taught the elements
of the fine arts and a love of beauty in Nature.</p>

<p class='c001'>To make sure of a rich harvest, milliners, when a new fashion
has appeared, manufacture all their goods in that style, so that
it is almost impossible to buy any others, all of which are declared
“bad form.” And their poor victims meekly submit to this
tyranny!</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <em>Tyranny of the Ugly Majority.</em>—This is another form
of tyranny from which ladies suffer. Most women are ugly and
ungraceful, and resent the contrast which beautiful women, naturally
and becomingly attired, would present to their own persons:
hence they favour the crinolette, the bustle, the corset, the long,
trailing dresses, the sleeve-puffs at the shoulders, etc., because such
fashionable devices make all women look equally ugly and ungraceful.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Armytage throws light on the origin of some absurd
fashions when she refers to the cases of “the patches first applied
to hide an ugly wen: of cushions carried to equalise strangely-deformed
hips; of long skirts to cover ugly feet; and long shoes
to hide an excrescence on the toe.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>Surely it is sufficient to expose the origin of such fashions to
make sensible women turn away from them in disgust. There
are indeed indications that the handsome women have at last
begun to find out the trick which the ugly majority have been
playing on them; and many are now dressing in such a way as to
show their personal beauty to advantage, undaunted by the fact
that ugly women pretend to be shocked at short dresses which
allow a pretty ankle to be seen, and jerseys which reveal the outlines
of a beautiful bust and waist.</p>

<p class='c001'>(4) <em>Cowardice.</em>—Many women adopt a fashion which they
dislike simply because they do not dare to face the remark of a
rival that they are not in fashion. As one of them frankly confesses:
“We women dress not to be simple, genuine, and harmonious,
or even to please you men, but <em>to brave each other’s criticism</em>.”
A noble motive, truly!</p>

<p class='c001'>One is often tempted to doubt the old saying that the first
desire of women is to be considered beautiful, on observing how
ready they are to sacrifice fifty per cent or more of their beauty
for the sake of being in fashion. Last summer, for instance, the
edict seems to have gone forth that the hair was no longer to be
allowed to form a graceful fringe over the forehead, but was to be
combed back tightly. So back it was combed, and beautiful
faces became rarer than ever. Leigh Hunt had written in vain
that the hair should be brought over large bare foreheads “as
vines are trailed over a wall.” Théophile Gautier, “the most
perfect poet in respect of poetical form that France has ever produced”
(Saintsbury), agreed with Schopenhauer regarding woman’s
æsthetic sense: “Women,” he says, “have only the sense of
fashion and not that of beauty. A woman will always find
beautiful the most abominable fashion if it is the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>genre suprême</i></span>
to wear that style.” He commends the women of Granada for
their good taste in preferring their lovely mantillas to the hideous
French hats, and hopes Spain may never be invaded by French
fashions and milliners.</p>

<p class='c001'>(5) <em>Sheepishness.</em>—It may seem ungallant to apply this term
to the conduct of a woman who imitates the habits of a sheep;
but, after all, which is the more gallant action: to applaud a
woman’s self-chosen ugliness, or, at least, to ignore it for fear of
offending her; or, on the other hand, to restore her beauty by
boldly holding up the mirror and allowing her to see herself as
others see her? It is the nature of a flock of sheep to jump
into the sea without a moment’s hesitation if their leader does
so. It is the nature of fashionable women to commit æsthetic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>suicide if their leader sets the example. Where is the
difference?</p>

<p class='c001'>It is surprising that Darwin did not refer to Fashion as furnishing
a most convincing proof of his theory that men are
descended from apelike ancestors. One of the ape’s most conspicuous
traits is imitativeness—blind, silly, slavish imitation:
hence the verb “to ape.” Blind, silly, slavish imitation is also
the essence of Fashion. Imitativeness implies a low order of
mind, a lack of originality. The more a man is intellectually
removed from the ape, the less is he inclined to imitate blindly.
Men of genius are a law unto themselves, while inferior minds can
only re-echo or plagiarise. Just so the prevalent anxiety to be in
fashion is a tacit confession of mental inferiority, of insufficient
independence of taste and originality to choose a style suited to
one’s individual requirements.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>INDIVIDUALISM <em>VERSUS</em> FASHION</h3>

<p class='c013'>Fashion is a deadly enemy of Romantic Love, not only because
it makes women sacrifice their Beauty to unhealthful garments and
habits, but because it obliterates <em>individuality</em>, on which the
ardour of Love depends. “Why don’t girls marry?” asks Mrs.
Haweis. “Because the press is great, and girls are undistinguishable
in the crowd. The distinguishable ones marry—those who
are beautiful or magnetic in some way, whose characters have
some definite colouring, and who can make their <em>individuality</em>
felt. I would have said—who can make themselves in any way
conspicuous, but that the word has been too long associated with
an <em>undesirable</em> prominence. Yet after all, prominence is the thing
needed—prominence of character, or <em>individuality</em>. Men, so to
speak, pitch upon the girls they can see: those who are completely
negative, unnoticeable, colourless, formless, invisible, are
left behind.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Women, in their eagerness to sacrifice their individuality to
Fashion, forget that <em>fashion leaders are never in fashion</em>, <i>i.e.</i> that
<em>they</em> always adopt a new style as soon as the crowd has aped
them: wherefore it is doubly silly to join the apes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mlle. Sarah Bernhardt never allows a corset to deform her
figure and mar her movements: and who has not had occasion
to admire the inimitable grace of this actress? But how many
women have the courage thus to sacrifice Fashion to Grace and
Beauty?</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet, notwithstanding the continuance of the corset and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>bustle mania and Parisian hats, it may be asserted that women are
just at present more sensibly dressed than they have been for some
generations, and there is <em>some</em> disposition to listen to the artistic
and hygienic advice of reformers. Unfortunately, the history of
Fashion does not tend to confirm any optimistic hopes that may
be based on this fact. There have been periods heretofore when
women became comparatively sensible, only to relapse again into
utter barbarism. Thus we read that “after the straight gown
came the fardingale, which in turn developed into the hoop with
its concomitants of patches, paint, and high-heeled shoes.” Then
came the reaction: “Short waists and limp, clinging draperies
came in to expose every contour; stays and corsets were for a
time discredited, only to be reintroduced, and with them the
whole cycle of fashions which had once already had their day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Experience shows that argumentation, ridicule, malicious or
good-natured, and satire, are equally powerless against Fashion.
Progress can only be hoped for in two ways—by instructing
women in the elementary laws of beauty in nature and mankind,
and by destroying the superstitious halo around the word <em>Fashion</em>.
It has just been shown that a disposition to imitate a fashion set
by others is always a sign of inferior intellect and rudimentary
taste; and the time no doubt will come when this fact will be
generally recognised, and when it will be considered anything but
a compliment to have it said that one follows the flock of fashionable
imitators.</p>

<p class='c001'>The progress of democratic institutions and sentiments will aid
in emancipating women from the slavery of Fashion. Empresses
who can set the fashion for two continents are becoming scarce;
and the woman of the future will no doubt open her eyes wide
in astonishment on reading that in the nineteenth century most
women allowed some mysterious personage to prescribe what they
should wear. “Can it be <em>possible</em>,” she will exclaim, "that my
poor dear grandmothers did not know that what is food for one
person is poison for another, and that any fashion universally
followed means æsthetic suicide for nine-tenths of the women who
adopt it? <em>I</em> am <em>my own fashion-leader</em>, and wear only what is
becoming to my <em>individual</em> style of beauty. What a preposterous
notion to proclaim that any particular colour or cut is to be exclusively
fashionable this year for all women, for blondes and
brunettes, for the tall and the short, the stout and the slim alike!
What <em>could</em> have induced those women thus to annihilate their
own beauty deliberately? And not only their beauty, but their
comfort as well. For I see that in New York, Fashion used to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>decree that women must exchange their light, comfortable summer
clothes for heavier autumn fabrics exactly in the middle of September,
although the last two weeks of September are often the
hottest part of the year. And the women, almost without exception,
obeyed this decree!</p>

<p class='c001'>“And then those long trailing dresses! How they must have
added to their ease and grace of movement in the ballroom, tucked
up clumsily or held in the hand! And it seems that these trails
were even worn in the dirty streets, for I see that at one time the
Dresden authorities forbade women to sweep the streets with their
dresses; and in one of Mr. Ruskin’s works I find this advice to
girls: ‘Your walking dress must never touch the ground at all.
I have lost much of the faith I once had in the common sense,
and even in the personal delicacy, of the present race of average
English women, by seeing how they will allow their dresses to
sweep the streets if it is <em>the fashion to be scavengers</em>.’”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>MASCULINE FASHIONS</h3>

<p class='c013'>In his emancipation from Fashion man has made much more
progress than woman. There is still a considerable number of
shallow-brained young “society men” who naïvely and minutely
accept the slight variations introduced every year in the cut and
style of cravats, shirts, and evening-dress by cunning tailors, in
order to compel men to throw away last season’s suits and order
new ones. But much larger is the number of men who disregard
such innovations, and laugh at the silly persons who meekly accept
them, even when their taste is offended by such new fashions as
the hideous collars and hats with which the market is occasionally
flooded.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a time when men spent as much time and money on
dress in a week as they now do in a year; a time when men were
as strictly ruled by capricious, cunning Fashion as women are to-day.
Lord March, we read, “laid a wager that he would make
fashionable the most humiliating dress he could think of. Accordingly,
he wore a blue coat with crimson collar and cuffs—a livery,
and not a tasteful livery—but he won his bet.” After the battle
of Agincourt, it is said, “the Duc de Bourbon, in order to ransom
King John, sold his overcoat to a London Jew, who gave no more
than its value, we may be pretty sure, but nevertheless gave 5200
crowns of gold for it. It seems to have been a mass of the most
precious gems.” The Duke of Buckingham “had twenty-seven
suits of clothes made, the richest that embroidery, lace, silk, velvet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>silver, gold, and gems could contribute; one of which was a white
uncut velvet, set all over, both suit and cloak, with diamonds
valued at fourscore thousand pounds, besides a great feather stuck
all over with diamonds, as were also his sword, girdle, hat, and
spurs.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Spencer cites two amusing instances of masculine subjection
to fashion in Africa and mediæval Europe. Among the Darfurs
in Africa, “If the sultan, being on horseback, happens to fall off,
all his followers must fall off likewise; and should any one omit
this formality, however great he may be, he is laid down and
beaten.” “In 1461, Duke Philip of Burgundy, having had his
hair cut during an illness, issued an edict that all the nobles of
his states should be shorn also. More than five hundred persons
sacrificed their hair.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So far as men are still subject to the influence of ugly fashions,
they differ from women in at least frankly acknowledging the
ugliness of these fashions. Whereas most women admire, or pretend
to admire, corsets, high-heeled boots, crinolettes, bustles, etc.,
there are few men who do not detest <i>e.g.</i> the unshapely, baggy
trousers, which were so greatly abhorred by the æsthetic sense of
the ancient Greeks; and most men to-day (except those who have
ugly legs) would gladly wear knee-breeches, if they could do so
without making themselves too conspicuous. Herein lies the
greatest impediment to dress reform. To make oneself very conspicuous
is justly considered a breach of good manners; and few
have the courage, like Mr. Oscar Wilde, to make martyrs and
butts of ridicule of themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>But if individuals are comparatively powerless, clubs of acknowledged
standing might make themselves very useful to the cause
of Personal Beauty, as affected by dress, if they would vote to
adopt in a body certain reforms as regards trousers, hats, and
evening-dress. Then it would no longer be said of a man rationally
dressed that he is eccentric, but that he belongs to the X——
Club; and many outsiders would immediately follow suit for the
coveted distinction of being taken for members of that club. Thus
both the wise and the foolish would be gratified.</p>

<p class='c001'>As showing how invariably and consistently Fashion is the
handmaid of ugliness, it is curious to note that the several styles
of dress worn by men are fashionable in proportion to their ugliness.
For the greatest occasions the swallow-tail or evening-dress
is prescribed. Next in rank is the ugly frock-coat, for morning
calls. Of late, it is true, the more becoming “cut-away” has
been tolerated in place of the frock-coat; but the sack-coat, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>alone follows the natural outlines of the body, and neither has a
caudal appendage, like the evening-dress, nor, like the frock-coat,
gives the impression that a man’s waist extends down to his knees,
is altogether tabooed at social gatherings, except those of the most
informal kind.</p>

<p class='c001'>Man’s evening-dress is so uniquely unæsthetic and ugly that
fashionable women have of course long been eyeing it with envy
and have gradually adopted some of its features. One of these is
the chimney-pot hat, the cause of so much premature baldness and
discomfort. But women are not quite so foolish as men in this
matter; for they do not wear tall hats at evening-parties and the
opera, but only when out riding, where the necessity of dodging
about to keep them on against the force of the wind and the blows
of overhanging boughs, compels them to go through all sorts of
grotesque gymnastics with neck and head. If they wore a more
rational and becoming head-dress on horseback they might easily
look pretty and graceful, which would be fatal to their chances of
being considered <a id='corr393.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='fashionable'>fashionable.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_393.19'><ins class='correction' title='fashionable'>fashionable.</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>In comparing masculine and feminine fashions, we must note
that trousers and swallow-tailed coats, though ugly, are harmless;
while high-heeled shoes, corsets, chignons, etc., are as fatal to
health as to Personal Beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is sometimes claimed in behalf of Fashion that, though it
often favours ugliness, it establishes a rule and model for all;
whereas, if everything were left to individual taste, the result
might be still more disastrous. Nonsense. Rare as good taste is
among women, a modicum is commonly present; and there are
extremely few who, if not overawed by the Fashion Fetish, would
ever invent or adopt such hideous irrepressible monstrosities as
bustles, crinolines, chignons, trailing dresses, Chinese boots, bird-corpse
hats, etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>A protest must, finally, be made against the horrible figures
which in our fashion papers are constantly offered as models of
style and appearance. Even in the best of them, such as Harper’s
<cite>Bazar</cite>, which frequently points out the injuriousness of tight
lacing, female figures are printed every week with hideously
narrow waists, such as no woman could possibly possess unless she
were in the last stages of consumption, or some other wasting
disease.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHEST AND BOSOM</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>FEMININE BEAUTY</h3>

<p class='c013'>Burke, in his chapter on “Gradual Variation” as a characteristic
of Beauty, begs us to “observe that part of a beautiful woman
where she is perhaps the most beautiful, about the neck and
breasts; the smoothness, the softness, the easy and insensible
swell; the variety of the surface, which is never for the smallest
space the same; the deceitful maze through which the unsteady
eye slides giddily, without knowing where to fix, or whither it is
carried. Is not this a demonstration of that change of surface,
continual, and yet hardly perceptible at any point, which forms
one of the greatest constituents of beauty?”</p>

<p class='c001'>There is reason to believe that the beautifully-rounded form of
the female bosom is a result of æsthetico-sexual selection; for
primitive human tribes resemble in this respect the lower animals.
Says the famous anatomist Hyrtl: “It is only among the white
and yellow races that the breasts, in their compact virginal condition,
have a hemispheric form, while those of negresses of a
corresponding age and physique are more elongated, pointed,
turned outwards and downwards; in a word, more like the teats
of animals.” Even the Arabian poets sing of the charms of a
goatlike breast. In the Soudan older women, when at work,
sometimes throw their breasts over the shoulder to prevent them
from being in the way; and “the women of the Basutos, a Kaffir
tribe, carry their children on the back, and pass the breast to them
under the <a id='corr394.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='arm.'>arm.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_394.26'><ins class='correction' title='arm.'>arm.”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>It is a very interesting and important fact that not only do we
find more beauty among the higher than among the lower races of
mankind, but the superior beauty of civilised races is also <em>of a
more permanent kind</em>. This truth is admirably illustrated in the
following remarks by Dr. Peschuel L&oelig;schke: The breasts of the
Loango negress, he says, “approach the conic rather than the
hemispheric form; they often have a too small and insufficiently
gradated basis, and in rare extreme cases have almost the appearance
of teats, besides being unequally developed. Breasts of such
a shape are naturally much more easily affected by the law of
gravitation, and soon become changed into the pendent bags which
we find so ugly, especially among Africans, although they also occur
among other tribes, and are not unknown among civilised peoples.
The superior form, with a broad basis, is naturally the more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>enduring, and remains in many cases an ornament of women of a
more advanced age.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Savages and Orientals, being deficient in æsthetic taste, admire
an excessively-developed bust. Europeans, on the other hand,
long ago recognised the connection between such a bust and
clumsy, unhealthy corpulence, suggesting advanced age. The
same appears to have been true of the most refined nations of
antiquity. Says Professor Kollmann: “The ancient as well as
the modern inhabitants of the Nile region appear, in the majority
of cases, like those of India, to possess hemispheric breasts, for
neither in the sphinxes or other superhuman beings, nor in the
images of human beauties, do we come across pointed breasts....
The Romans did not consider large bosoms a mark of beauty.
Among European women the Portuguese are said to have the
largest busts, the Castilians the smallest. To judge by Rubens’s
nude figures, the Netherland women appear to rival the Portuguese
in exuberant bosoms.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In Greek works of art, says Winckelmann, “the breast or
bosom of female figures is never exuberant.” “Among ideal
figures, the Amazons alone have large and fully-developed breasts.”
“The form of the breasts in the figures of divinities is virginal in
the extreme, since their beauty was made to consist in the
moderateness of their size. A stone, found in the Island of Naxos,
was smoothly polished and placed upon them for the purpose of
repressing an undue development.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Modern Fashion, for a wonder, endorses the Greek standard of
beauty as regards a moderately-developed bust. But it was not
always thus. It is Fashion that induces some savages whose
breasts are naturally long and hanging to use bandages which
make them still more hanging and elongated in form. In Spain,
during the sixteenth and seventeenth century, and in other parts
of Europe, on the contrary, Fashion prescribed flat chests. Plates
of lead were tied on the breasts of young girls with such force
that sometimes the natural form was replaced by an actual depression
where “love’s pillows” should have been. In some parts of
South Germany and the Tyrol a similar fashion prevails to the
present day among the lower classes, the result being not only a
sacrifice of beauty, but a great mortality among the children, that
have to be reared artificially in consequence of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>But if modern Fashion has a correct standard of taste in this
matter, it nevertheless encourages practices which lead to as
disastrous results as the Spanish fashions of three centuries ago.
“The horrible custom of wearing pads,” says the author of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span><cite>Ugly Girl Papers</cite> “is the ruin of natural figures, by heating and
pressing down the bosom.... A low, deep bosom, rather than a
bold one, is a sign of grace in a full-grown woman, and a full bust
is hardly admirable in an unmarried girl. Her figure should be
all curves, but slender, promising a fuller beauty when maturity
is reached. One is not fond of over-ripe years.... Due attention
to the general laws of health always has its effect in restoring
the bust to its roundness.... Weakness of any kind affects the
contour of the figure, and it is useless to try to improve it in any
other way than by restoring the strength where it is wanting.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The same author, whose book is brimful of useful advice, not
only to “ugly girls,” but to those who have beauty and wish to
preserve it, also recommends battledore, swinging the skipping-rope
over the shoulder, swinging by the hand from a rope, as well as
playing ball, “bean bags,” pillow fights, and especially daily vocal
exercises with corset off and lungs deeply inflated—as excellent
means of improving the bust.</p>

<p class='c001'>If women could be made to realise how rarely they succeed,
even with the aid of the cleverest milliner, in counterfeiting a
properly developed chest, they would, perhaps, be more willing to
submit to the exercise or regimen requisite for the acquirement
and preservation of Personal Beauty. Flat chests are a consequence
of insufficient muscular exercise, insufficient fresh air, and
insufficient food. The main reason why the majority of girls in
the world are over-delicate and fragile is because they do not get
enough properly-cooked food in which <em>fat is introduced in such a
way as to be palatable and digestible</em>. The adipose layer between
the skin and the muscles contributes so much to the undulating
roundness of contour peculiar to feminine beauty, that Kollmann
places it among the differentiating sexual characteristics.</p>

<p class='c001'>Too exuberant busts, on the other hand, are the result of too
much indulgence in fattening food, combined with lack of exercise
in the open air, which would consume the fat. Maternity, with
proper hygienic precautions, is never fatal to a fine bust.</p>

<p class='c001'>That savages, like their civilised brethren and sisters, owe their
deformed chests entirely to their indolence and neglect of the laws
of health, is shown by the fact that there are notable exceptions—energetic
tribes living healthy lives, and therefore blessed with
beautiful figures. Thus Mr. A. R. Wallace tells us regarding some
of the Amazon valley Indians that “their figures are generally
superb; and I have never felt so much pleasure in gazing at the
finest statue as at these living illustrations of the beauty of the
human form. The development of the bust is such as I believe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>never exists in the best-formed European, exhibiting <em>a splendid
series of convex undulations, without a hollow in any part of it</em>.”
And what he says in another place regarding a neighbouring tribe
explains the secret of this Beauty: “Though some of them were
too fat, most of them had splendid figures, and many of them were
very pretty. Before daylight in the morning all were astir and
came to the river to wash. It is the chilliest hour of the twenty-four,
and when we were wrapping our sheet or blanket more
closely around us, we could hear the plunges and splashings of
these early bathers. Rain or wind is all alike to them: their
morning bath is never dispensed with.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>MASCULINE BEAUTY</h3>

<p class='c013'>Wincklemann remarks that, among the ancient Greeks, “a
proudly-arched chest was regarded as a universal attribute of
beauty in male figures. The father of the poets describes Neptune
with such a chest, and Agamemnon as resembling him; and such
a one Anakreon desired to see in the image of the youth whom he
loved.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A prominent, <em>arched</em> chest,” says Professor Kollmann, “is an
infallible sign of a vigorous, <em>healthy</em> skeleton; whereas a narrow,
<em>flat</em>, and, still more, a bent thorax is a physical index of bodily
weakness and inherited <em>decrepitude</em>. An arched chest imparts to
a man’s whole figure an aspect of physical perfection, not to say
sublimity, as may be seen in the ancient statues of gods, in which
the chest is intentionally made more prominent than it ever can be
in a man, presumably in order to weaken the impression of the
chest’s more <em>animal</em> neighbour, the abdomen. There is a deep
meaning in our phraseology which localises courage, boldness,
martial valour, in a man’s vigorous breast.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I have italicised several words in this quotation, because they
tersely show how writers on art are guided both by the positive
and negative tests of Beauty formulated in another part of this
volume.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>MAGIC EFFECT OF DEEP BREATHING</h3>

<p class='c013'>Indolence is the mother of ugliness. No one who realises the
absolute necessity to Health of a sufficient supply of fresh air can
wonder at the rarity of Beauty in the world, if he considers that
nineteen people out of every twenty are <em>too lazy to breathe properly</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is estimated that there are from 75 to 100 cubic inches of
air which always remain in a man’s lungs. About an equal amount
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>of “supplemental” air remains after an <em>ordinary</em> expiration; and
only 20 to 30 inches of what Professor Huxley calls “tidal air”
passes in and out. But this “tidal air” can be largely increased
in amount by the habit of breathing deeply and <em>slowly</em>, whereby
an additional supply of oxygen is supplied to the lungs, which is
a thousand times better for the health than quinine, iron pills, or
any other tonic. There are few persons whose health and personal
appearance would not be improved vastly if they would take <em>several
daily meals</em> of fresh air—consisting of 20-50 deep inspirations in a
park or some other place where the air is pure and bracing. Slowly
inhale as much air as you can get into the lungs without discomfort
(avoiding a strain), and then exhale again just as slowly. After a
while the habit will be formed of <em>constantly</em> breathing more deeply
than formerly, both awake and asleep; thus bringing into regular
use a larger part of the lungs’ surface. It is the slight sense of
fatigue at first accompanying deep breathing which prevents most
people from enjoying its benefits; but when once this natural
indolence is overcome the reward of deep breathing is analogous
to the delicious exhilaration which follows a brisk walk or a cold
bath.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is important to note that all breathing, whether deep or
ordinary, should be done through the nose, as thus the air is
warmed before it reaches the delicate lungs, and the mucous
membranes remain moist, thus preventing those disagreeable
enemies of refreshing sleep—a dry mouth and snoring.</p>

<p class='c001'>Habitual deep breathing adds to Personal Beauty not only by
exercising the muscles of the chest, which thus becomes more
arched and prominent relatively to the abdomen, but also by
throwing back the neck and head and compelling the whole body
to assume a straight, military attitude. We are all taught as
children, says Professor Kollmann, to hold ourselves straight; but
rarely is the information added that the best way to secure an
erect, manly bearing and a dignified gait is by cultivating the habit
of deep breathing. “It is worthy of notice that forcible breathing,
such as results from a correct bearing, from prolonged sojourn and
exercise in the open air, in hunting, gymnastic exercises, riding,
etc., not only increases the chest for the moment, but permanently....
There are proofs in abundance that even with young persons
of eighteen to twenty years, the whole circumference of the chest
is capable of considerable widening under such circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A medical writer, referring to the fact that children frequently
become round-shouldered from sitting for hours and bending over
a desk, makes these very sensible suggestions:—</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>“In the first place, the lungs should be fully expanded by
drawing in all the air that is possible; this process will be aided
by throwing the shoulders well back, and you should encourage your
children to do this frequently in the open air when going to and
coming from school. Children are easily bribed, and we would
suggest to school teachers a simple and effective way of accomplishing
this desirable end. This forcible expansion of the lungs
will enlarge the chest and increase its circumference. Then let the
teacher, at the beginning of the session, measure each child’s chest
and record the circumference, then explain and demonstrate to them
how to forcibly fill the lungs, and offer a premium at the end of
the session to the child who shall have most increased the
circumference of his chest; make it worth their while to expand
their lungs, as much so as we now do for them to expand their
minds, and the result will be wonderful.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>A MORAL QUESTION</h3>

<p class='c013'>An eminent authority on the physiology of the vocal organs,
Dr. Lennox Browne, remarks (in <cite>Voice, Song, and Speech</cite>), that
“respiratory exercises, and subsequently lessons in reading, reciting,
and singing, are oftentimes of the greatest use in strengthening
a weak chest; and, indeed, it is not too much to say, <em>in
arresting consumption</em>.” Another excellent authority, Mr. A. B.
Bach, points out (in his <cite>Musical Education and Vocal Culture</cite>,
which should be consulted by all who wish to learn the art of
Deep Breathing) that “very few vocalists die of consumption,”
owing to the fact that they properly exercise their lungs and
chests.</p>

<p class='c001'>This brings us face to face with a moral question of enormous
importance, to which writers on ethics have by no means as yet
given the attention it loudly clamours for. Consumption, we read,
“is a disease of great frequency and severity, which, in the civilised
nations of Europe, produces from <em>one-sixth to one-tenth of the total
mortality</em>, in ordinary times.” Now if, as we have just seen,
consumption can be arrested and cured by proper exercise of the
lungs and chest in pure air, does it not follow that the neglect of
such exercises makes certain parties criminally responsible for the
greater number of deaths from consumption? It is “proved by
careful inquiries that the workshops of tailors, printers, and other
businesses carried on in close, ill-ventilated apartments, by large
numbers of workmen, are, in a very aggravated sense, <em>nurseries of
consumption</em>. Cotton and linen factories have also been shown,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>when ill-regulated, to be largely responsible for the death of their
inmates from this disease.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Why should not the owners of factories who refuse to ventilate
their buildings be held responsible for the ill-health, the early
decrepitude and death of many of the workers, and the workers’
weakly, consumptive children who die young? As England alone
has over three hundred thousand women engaged in cotton manufacture,
the amount of ill-health, early senility, ugliness, consumption,
etc., bred by criminal neglect of hygienic precautions, is
appalling to the imagination. A case was mentioned in the
American papers a few years ago, where the windows in a factory
were <em>nailed fast</em> to prevent the poor, suffocating girls from opening
them. And, strange to say, the owner of that factory was not
immediately lynched. Surely, if ever a monster deserved to be
hanged to the nearest tree, it was the man who ordered those
windows to be nailed down.</p>

<p class='c001'>But factory owners are by no means the only persons who are
thus responsible for indirect manslaughter by foul-air poisoning.
Thousands of loving mothers and fathers blaspheme their Creator
in attributing the early death of their children to a “dispensation
of Providence,” when the plain truth, brutally expressed, is that
they killed them with the poisoned air, indigestible food, and
insufficient exercise that brought on the fatal consumption. To
say that the disease was hereditary is only to shift the hygienic
crime on the shoulders of the grand-parents.</p>

<p class='c001'>In human courts of justice ignorance of the law is not considered
an excuse for the commission of crime. If the same principle
holds true in some future world where human actions will be
judged, what terrible indictments will be brought against some
parents for crimes committed against the health and life of their
children and grandchildren, for neglecting to learn the laws of
health, as laid down in physiological and hygienic textbooks!</p>

<p class='c001'>Inasmuch as Personal Beauty is the flower and symbol of perfect
Health, it might be shown, by following out this argument, that
<em>ugliness is a sin, and man’s first duty the cultivation of Beauty</em>.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>NECK AND SHOULDER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Nowhere are the æsthetic laws of Gradation and gentle Curvature
more beautifully illustrated than in the neck—the column of
the head. Note how a lovely woman’s neck repeats on a small
scale the delicate contours of the trunk—widened at the base and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>at the top, with a subtle inward slope towards the middle. Note,
also, how imperceptibly it passes into the shoulders, which continue
the gentle curve in a downward slope, unless prevented by the
deforming corset.</p>

<p class='c001'>Man’s neck is less cylindrical than woman’s, and presents four
slightly flattened surfaces; while his shoulders are not sloping, but
square. We not only pardon, but even admire and demand this
conformation in man; because in judging masculine beauty we are
guided by dynamic as much as by æsthetic considerations, while
the fair sex is judged by the laws of beauty alone. A masculine
neck is in good form if it shows traces of the sinews and muscles
which give it strength; but in a woman’s neck the feminine
adipose layer under the skin must obliterate all such traces of
masculinity,—especially the bones at the junction of neck and
breast, the prominence of which suggests emaciation and disease.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the face of such considerations, how can any one maintain
that man is more beautiful than woman? He may show more
character, more individuality, more originality than a fine woman,
but more beauty <em>never</em>. And the fact that in Sexual Selection
women have always been chiefly guided by dynamic considerations—<i>i.e.</i>
vigour, boldness, “manliness”—whereas men have been
fascinated by beauty alone, explains why, as Schopenhauer asserts,
women are the “unæsthetic sex,” and why their taste for Personal
Beauty, not being exercised, like that of man, in the selection of a
mate, is so lamentably callous to the deformities resulting from
corsets and other instruments of torture.</p>

<p class='c001'>The neck being the pivot on which the head executes its movements,
it is evident that it requires attention from the point of
view of Grace as well as of Beauty. To how many women has it
ever occurred that as the feet are taught to dance lithely, the arms
to execute eloquent gestures, so the neck should be trained to
naturally assume graceful attitudes? Great paintings and famous
actresses should be studied from this point of view. Always bear
in mind that grace of movement often excels beauty of form in the
power of inspiring Romantic Love. And remember that any pains
you take to acquire grace will not only multiply your own charms,
but will establish a habit of graceful movement in your muscles
which will be inherited by your children. It is owing to this circumstance
that the children of truly refined families are born with
an ease, grace, and dignity of movement and mien which it is
impossible for “self-made” persons to acquire in a lifetime,
because they are not born with an inherited <em>talent</em> for graceful
movement.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>ARM AND HAND</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>EVOLUTION AND SEXUAL DIFFERENCES</h3>

<p class='c013'>One of the redeeming features of what is ironically called “full-dress”
is the opportunity it gives of admiring a woman’s shapely
neck, shoulders, and arms—if she has such. No healthy woman
of the well-to-do classes need have an ill-favoured arm if she has
a sensible mother, who compels her from her childhood to exercise
her muscles. The great preponderance of leathery, angular, bony
arms at ballrooms shows, therefore, how shamefully the hygienic
arts of personal adornment are neglected in our best society. The
stifling heat which commonly prevails at social gatherings suggests
the thought that many ladies are indifferent to the display of their
bony arms on the grounds given in Sydney Smith’s exclamation:
“Heat, ma’am! it was so dreadful here that I found there was
nothing left for it but to take off my flesh and sit in my bones.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A meagre, skinny arm is objectionable not only because it offends
against all the conditions of Beauty—plump roundness, softness,
fresh colour, smoothness, gradual tapering to the wrist—but
because it is associated with the aspect of old age and disease;
and again, because it suggests man’s lowly origin by its approximation
to the appearance of the arms in our simian country cousins.</p>

<p class='c001'>Man’s arm has become differentiated from the ape’s not only in
the matter of greater muscular rotundity and smoothness, <i>i.e.</i> loss
of hair, but also in regard to length. An ape’s arms are much
longer than a white man’s, the negro’s being intermediate. Says
Mr. Tylor: “In an upright position and reaching down with the
middle finger, the gibbon can touch its foot, the orang its ankle,
the chimpanzee its knee, while man only reaches partly down his
thigh.... Negro soldiers standing at drill bring the middle
finger-tip an inch or two nearer the knee than white men can do,
and some have been even known to touch the knee-pan.” Taking
this in connection with the fact that the arms of sailors,
who use them constantly in climbing, are longer than those of
soldiers, we may safely infer that man’s arms have gradually
become shorter because he has ceased to climb trees; while the
greater muscular rotundity, especially of the forearm, has been
acquired through the varied activity and movements of the hand
and fingers: a circumstance almost self-evident on physiological
principles, and furthermore corroborated by the fact that negroes,
unskilled in trades which call for manipulation of the separate
fingers, again occupy an intermediate position. “Even in muscular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>negroes the arms are less rotund,” says Professor Carl Vogt; and,
according to Van der H&oelig;ven, the skin between the fingers reaches
up higher in the negro, which must impede activity.</p>

<p class='c001'>The peculiar arrangement of the hair on man’s arm has been
referred to by Wallace and Darwin as one of the countless signs
arguing our descent from apelike ancestors. On the arm of man,
as of most anthropoid apes, the hair “tends to converge from above
and below to a point at the elbow.” Now it is known that the
gorilla, as well as the orang, “sits in pelting rain with his hands
over his head”; and Mr. Wallace, therefore, suggests that the
present inclination of the hair on man’s arms is simply a survival
of the time when his arboreal ancestors used to sit in that fashion,
the hair having gradually assumed the direction which would most
easily allow the rain to run off.</p>

<p class='c001'>The evolution theory that the hair on the arm, as on the body
in general, was lost through Sexual Selection, is corroborated by
the fact that woman’s arm has made more progress toward complete
smoothness than man’s, owing to the circumstance that man is
in Sexual Selection more guided by æsthetic, woman by dynamic,
considerations. Yet there can be no doubt that a hairy arm and
hand are always ugly, in man as in woman, not only on account of
their simian suggestiveness, but because they cover the smooth
skin and its delicate tints, and, moreover, especially if black, are
very apt to make the arm and hand look as if they needed a good
scrubbing. Hair on the hand may sometimes be permanently
removed by passing the hand quickly and repeatedly through a
large flame—a much less painful process than the use of pincers.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <em>muscular</em> deviations from the lines of beauty are much
more pardonable in a man’s arm than the hair, although it is
evident that a professional athlete’s excessively muscular arm is
æsthetically objectionable, however much it may be admired on
other grounds. To feminine beauty, and the chances of inspiring
Love, an arm which is so muscular as to obliterate the lines of
beauty is absolutely fatal. Among the labouring classes there are
many women whose arms are so hard and sinewy that the very
bones to which they are attached have become heavy and masculine,
so that it becomes difficult to tell a woman’s from a man’s skeleton,
which ordinarily is very easy.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CALISTHENICS AND MASSAGE</h3>

<p class='c013'>It is, however, hardly necessary to refer to these facts as a
warning to girls not to use their arms too much. The danger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>almost always lies the other way, and what girls need is a set of
intelligent directions for securing a shapely arm. If the arm is too
plump the method discussed in preceding pages for the general
reduction of corpulence will also affect the arm. If too thin, which
is much more frequently the case in young women, don’t be afraid
that exercise will make them thinner—on the ground that hard
labourers are commonly meagre. It is only <em>excessive</em> exercise that
produces leanness, by burning away all the fat. Moderate exercise
develops the muscles—the plastic material of beauty—and stimulates
the appetite, so that the fat-cushion under the skin also
increases in depth, covering up the angular outlines of bones,
muscles, and sinews.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a suggestive fact that the word calisthenics—"the art of
promoting the health of the body by exercise"—comes from two
Greek words meaning “beautiful” and “strength.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So many books have been written on calisthenics that it is
needless to repeat here minute directions for training the muscles
of the arm or any other part of the body. One bit of sensible
advice may, however, be quoted from the <cite>Ugly Girl Papers</cite>:
“Throwing quoits and sweeping are good exercises to develop the
arms. There is nothing like three hours of housework a day for
giving a woman a good figure, and if she sleep in tight cosmetic
gloves, she need not fear that her hands will be spoiled. The time
to form the hand is in youth, and with thimbles for the finger-tips,
and close gloves lined with cold cream, every mother might secure
a good hand for her daughter.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is an ill wind that blows no man good. The incessant piano-banging
and violin-scraping of thousands of unmusical young ladies
has at least one thing to be said in its favour: it helps to round
and beautify the arms of these young players.</p>

<p class='c001'>Active exercise is the surest and quickest way of securing muscular
rotundity. But in cases where, owing to some infirmity,
long-continued spontaneous exertion is out of the question, <em>massage</em>,
which has been defined as “passive exercise,” may be resorted to as
of calisthenic value. It should only be performed by an expert, and
always centripetally, <i>i.e.</i> in the direction of the heart. It facilitates
the flow of the venous current, which in the arms and lower limbs
has to struggle upwards against the force of gravitation; and to this
is partly due its refreshing effect. As Americans are the most
nervous and sensitive people in the world, it seems probable that
the feeling of ease following the facilitating of the venous flow has
taught them instinctively to assume that peculiar position, with the
feet on a chair or table, which has been so often ridiculed by Europeans.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>THE “SECOND FACE”</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“The beauty of a youthful hand,” says Winckelmann “consists
in a moderate degree of plumpness, and a scarcely observable depression,
resembling a soft shadow, over the articulations of the
fingers, where, if the hand is plump, there is a dimple. The fingers
taper gently towards their extremities, like finely-shaped columns;
and, in art, the articulations are not expressed. The fore part of
the terminating joint is not bent over, nor are the nails very long,
though both are common in the works of modern sculptors.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Balzac pointed out that “men of superior intellect almost always
have beautiful hands, the perfection of which is the distinctive
indication of a high destination.... The hand is the despair of
sculptors and painters when they wish to express the changing
labyrinth of its mysterious lineaments.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A fine hand is, indeed, a sign of superior intelligence in a much
more comprehensive sense than that which Balzac had in mind.
The difference between the simian and human faces is hardly
greater than the progress from an ape’s hand to a man’s in beauty
of outline, smoothness of surface, grace of movement, and varied
utility. The ape’s hand is hairy on the upper surface, hard and
callous on the lower. Except in climbing, its movements are
clumsy. The fingers have adapted themselves to the need of
climbing, and have become permanently bent in front, so that when
the animal goes on all fours it cannot walk on the palm, but only
on the bent knuckles.</p>

<p class='c001'>A step higher we have the negro’s hands, in which the fingers
are less independent and nimble, and the palmar fat-cushions less
developed and sensitive, than in our hands. These fat-cushions
serve to protect the blood-vessels as well as the delicate nerves,
which make the hand the principal organ of touch. The muscles
of the hand are more easily and instantaneously obedient to the
will than those of any other part of the body, except those of the
mouth and eyes; and hence it is that the hands are almost as good
an index of a man’s character, habits, and profession as his face,
and have been aptly called his “second face.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Division of labour is the index of progress in the evolution of
organs. To the fact that his feet have become exclusively adapted
to locomotion, leaving the hands free to serve as tools, man chiefly
owes his superiority to other animals. For what would superior
intellect avail him without the implements needed to carry out its
schemes? Feeling, grasping, handling, writing, sewing, playing an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>instrument, squeezing, caressing,—these are a few of the innumerable
functions of the human hand; while the ape’s is good for little
but climbing. The finger language of deaf mutes shows to what
subtle intellectual uses the hands can be put; and as for emotional
expression, are there any facial muscles which can indicate finer
shades of feeling than the infinitely varied touch with which a
pianist or violinist gives utterance to every mood and phase of
human passion?</p>

<p class='c001'>No wonder that, just as the face has had its physiognomists and
phrenologists, so the hand its chiromancers, who pretended, by
looking at its lines, not only to read character, but even to foretell
one’s fate. Books on this subject are indeed still published, which
shows that the race of fools is in no immediate danger of extinction.
Wrinkles in the face do bear some relation to character and experience;
but surely no one needs to be told that the palmar lines are
purely accidental—caused by the manner in which the skin is folded
when we close the hand.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>FINGER-NAILS</h3>

<p class='c013'>Our nails are modified claws—modified to their <a id='corr406.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='advantage'>advantage.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_406.19'><ins class='correction' title='advantage'>advantage.</ins></a></span>
When properly cared for, they are one of the greatest personal
ornaments—beginning and ending as they do with a delicate curve,
rounded on the surface, suffused with a gentle blush, and smooth
as ivory. They may also serve as a mode of expression and index
of nationality, as seen in these remarks by Mr. E. B. Tylor: “In
the Southern United States, till slavery was done away a few years
ago, the traces of Negro descent were noted with the utmost nicety.
Not only were the mixed breeds regularly classed as mulattos,
quadroons, and down to octoroons, but even where the mixture was
so slight that the untrained eye noticed nothing beyond a brunette
complexion, the intruder, who had ventured to sit down at a public
dinner-table, was called upon to show his hands, and the African
taint detected by the dark tinge at the root of the finger-nails.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Becker remarks that among the ancient Greeks “it was considered
very unseemly to appear with nails unpared”; nor did the
Greeks consider it beneath their dignity, like the Romans, to pare
their own nails.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Greeks, being an æsthetic nation, were guided in the treatment
of their nails by the sense of beauty. Elsewhere, however,
the idiotic notion that laziness is aristocratic led to a different
treatment of the nails. Mr. Tylor, in his <cite>Anthropology</cite>, gives an
illustration of the hand of a Chinese ascetic whose finger-nails are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>five or six times as long as his fingers. “Long finger-nails,” he
remarks, “are noticed even among ourselves as showing that the
owner does no manual labour, and in China and neighbouring
countries they are allowed to grow to a monstrous length as a
symbol of nobility, ladies wearing silver cases to protect them, or
at least as a pretence that they are there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Useless hands, with elongated nails, reverting to a clawlike
character, as “symbols of nobility!” The study of evolution
throws much sarcastic light on the fashionable follies of mankind.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>MANICURE SECRETS</h3>

<p class='c013'>According to the New York <cite>Analyst</cite>: “There are not nearly
as many secrets in manicure as people imagine. A little ammonia
or borax in the water you wash your hands with, and that water
just lukewarm, will keep the skin clean and soft. A little oatmeal
mixed with the water will whiten the hands. Many people use
glycerine on their hands when they go to bed, wearing gloves to
keep the bedding clean; but glycerine <a id='corr407.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>don’t</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_407.17'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>don’t</ins></a></span> agree with every one.
It makes some skins harsh and red. These people should rub
their hands with dry oatmeal and wear gloves in bed. The best
preparation for the hands at night is white of egg, with a grain of
alum dissolved in it.... The roughest and hardest hands can be
made soft and white in a month’s time by doctoring them a little
at bedtime, and all the tools you need are a nail-brush (avoid
metal), a bottle of ammonia, a box of powdered borax, and a little
fine white sand to rub the stains off, or a cut of lemon. Manicures
use acids in their shops, but the lemon is quite as good, and isn’t
poisonous, while the acids are.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the <cite>Ugly Girl Papers</cite> the following recipes are given:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“To give a fine colour to the nails, the hands and fingers must
be well lathered and washed with scented soap; then the nails
must be rubbed with equal parts of cinnabar and emery, followed
by oil of bitter almonds. To take white specks from the nails,
melt equal parts of pitch and turpentine in a small cup; add to it
vinegar and powdered sulphur. Rub this on the nails and the
specks will soon disappear. Pitch and myrrh melted together may
be used with the same results.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But, after all, what is the use of beautifying one’s hands as long
as ladies bow to the Fashion Fetish, which compels them to conceal
them in the skins of animals? To wear gloves on going out, as a
protection against rough weather and for the sake of cleanliness, is
rational enough; but to wear them at social gatherings is almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>as absurd as the compulsory impenetrable veils of Turkish women;
for does not the hand rank next to the face as an index of
character?</p>

<p class='c001'>Another stupidity of fashion is our enforced and cultivated
right-handedness. Despite the force of inherited habit, children
show a natural inclination toward using both their hands equally;
but they are constantly scolded and punished, until they have
succeeded, like their parents, in reducing one hand to a state of
imbecility, so to speak, which is constantly betrayed in awkward,
ungraceful action. Practising on a musical instrument, with
special attention to the left hand, has a tendency to correct this
awkwardness. Indeed, is there any part of the body that music
does not benefit? Dancing to a Strauss waltz gives elasticity to
the limbs and grace to the gait; singing is the most useful kind of
lung-gymnastics, and develops the chest; a musically-trained ear
modulates the voice to sweeter expression; while equally skilled
and graceful hands are acquired by practice on a musical instrument.
So that the word music, though much less comprehensive
than among the ancient Greeks, has lost none of the magic, beautifying
power they ascribed to it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Much of the ugliness in the world is due to the neglect of
parents in properly supervising the actions of their children, to
prevent the formation of bad habits, which ruin beauty irretrievably.
As an instance of what can be done in this direction may be cited
the following remark by a Philadelphia surgeon: “The school-girl
habit of biting the nails must be broken up at once. If in children,
rub a little extract of quassia on the finger-tips. This is so
bitter that they are careful not to taste it twice. Not only the
nails, but the whole finger and hand is often forfeited by neglect
in this respect.”</p>

<p class='c001'>By travelling from the shoulder down to the finger-tips we have
apparently interrupted our steady progress from toe to tip of the
body. But we shall see in a moment that the interruption is only
apparent, for our subject leads naturally “from Hand to Mouth.”</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>JAW, CHIN, AND MOUTH</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>HANDS <i>VERSUS</i> JAWS</h3>

<p class='c013'>Just as among some male ruminants the growth of horns as a
means of defence has apparently led to the disappearance of the
canine teeth, so man’s erect attitude, by leaving his hands free to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>do much of the work which inferior animals do with their jaws
and teeth, has gradually modified the appearance of his face,
greatly to its advantage. “The early male forefathers of man,”
says Darwin, “were probably furnished with great canine teeth;
but as they gradually acquired the habit of using stones, clubs, or
other weapons, for fighting with their enemies or rivals, they
would use their jaws and teeth less and less. In this case the
jaws, together with the teeth, would become reduced in size, as we
may feel almost sure from innumerable analogous cases.” And in
another place he remarks: “As the prodigious difference between
the skulls of the two sexes in the orang and gorilla stands in close
relation with the development of the immense canine teeth in the
males, we may infer that the reduction of the jaws and teeth in
the early progenitors of man must have led to a most striking and
favourable change in his appearance.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Why a “favourable” change? No doubt a male gorilla, if it
could be taught to pronounce an æsthetic judgment, would indignantly
scout the notion that our weak, delicate jaw is preferable
to its own massive bones; nor would a prognathous or “forward-jawed”
African or Australian admit that he is less beautiful than
the orthognathous or “upright-jawed” European. What right,
then, have we to claim that we alone have beautiful faces? Must
we not admit, with the Jeffrey Alison school, that it is all “a
matter of taste,” and that in so far as a heavy, projecting jaw
<em>appears</em> beautiful to a gorilla or a savage, it <em>is</em> beautiful to
them?</p>

<p class='c001'>The general answer to such questions as these has already been
given in another part of this volume. We need therefore only say
in brief <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>résumé</i></span> that a heavy, projecting, clumsy, brutal jaw probably
appears to a gorilla or a Hottentot <em>neither ugly nor beautiful</em>.
The æsthetic sense—as we can see among ourselves—is the last
and highest product of civilisation. Monkeys are apparently
excited by brilliant <em>colours</em>, but to beauty of <em>form</em> neither apes nor
the lower races and classes of man appear to be susceptible.</p>

<p class='c001'>Should a negro, however, on having his attention called to this
matter, claim that his prognathous face is more beautiful than our
orthognathous face, the retort simple would be that his imagination
is not sufficiently educated to understand our more refined and
delicate beauty; just as an Esquimaux prefers a rotten egg to a
fresh one, a working man a glass of fusil oil to one of tokay—simply
because their senses of taste and smell are not sufficiently
refined to appreciate <em>or even detect</em> the delicate flavour of a fresh
egg and the subtle bouquet of wine.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>Of the positive tests of beauty, Delicacy is the one which most
emphatically condemns the heavy, prognathous jaw and the accompanying
big mouth. Massive bones and clumsy movements are
everywhere the signs of excessive toil, fatal to beauty, as may be
seen on comparing the angular and almost masculine skeleton of a
labouring woman with the delicately-articulated joints of a “society
woman”; or the heavy structure of a dray-horse with the fine
contours of a race-horse; showing that Delicacy is always associated
with the other elements of beauty—Curvature, Gradation, Expression,
etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the manner in which the beauty of the mouth is proportioned
to its capability for Expression, Mr. Ruskin has made the following
interesting observations: “Taking the mouth, another source
of expression, we find it ugliest where it has none, as mostly in
fish; or perhaps where, without gaining much in expression of any
kind, it becomes a formidable destructive instrument, as again in
the alligator; and then, by some increase of expression, we arrive
at birds’ beaks, wherein there is much obtained by the different
ways of setting on the mandibles (compare the bills of the duck
and the eagle); and thence we reach the finely-developed lips of
the carnivora (which nevertheless lose their beauty in the actions
of snarling and biting); and from these we pass to the nobler,
because gentler and more sensitive, of the horse, camel, and fawn,
and so again up to man: only the principle is less traceable in the
mouths of the lower animals, because they are only in slight
measure capable of expression, and chiefly used as instruments, and
that of low function; whereas in man the mouth is given most
definitely as a means of expression, beyond and above its lower
functions.... The beauty of the animal form is in exact proportion
to the amount of moral or intellectual virtue expressed
by it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Shakspere, by the way, seems to differ from Ruskin’s theory
implied in this last sentence. According to Ruskin, animals “lose
their beauty in the actions of snarling and biting.” But man has
an action similar to snarling, namely, what Bell calls “that arching
of the lips so expressive of contempt, hatred, and jealousy.” It
is to this that Shakspere refers in these lines—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O what a deal of scorn looks beautiful</div>
      <div class='line'>In the contempt and anger of his lip.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>But the word “beautiful” is here evidently taken by Shakspere in
the wider sense of interesting and characteristic, and not in the
special æsthetic sense of formal and emotional beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>Delicacy and the capacity for varied and subtle Expression—these,
we may conclude, are the chief criteria of beauty in the
lower part of the face. Anatomically, it may be well to state here,
the word “face” does not include the forehead, but only extends
from the chin to the eyebrows. The upper and posterior part is
called the cranium or skull. It seems odd at first not to include
the forehead in the face, but there are scientific grounds for making
such a division, for a discussion of which the reader must be
referred to some anatomical text-book (<i>vide</i> Kollmann, pp. 82-85).</p>

<p class='c001'>To a certain extent the face and the cranium are independent
of one another in development and physiognomic significance.
And it should be noted that, contrary to the general impression, in
estimating the degree of intelligence and refinement, the face is a
safer guide than the cranium; for there are many powerful brains
in low and even receding foreheads, whereas a large projecting jaw
is almost invariably a sign of vulgarity or lack of delicate feeling.
We do not find a dog ugly because of his receding forehead; but
we do find that the most infallible way of giving a man’s picture a
brutal expression is by enlarging the jaw and mouth. It is the
deadliest weapon of the caricaturist.</p>

<p class='c001'>What makes a gorilla so frightfully ugly is the prominence and
massive preponderance of his face over his cranium. It is his
monstrous jaws, with their “simply brutal armature” of teeth,
that give him such a repulsive appearance. The gorilla’s mouth,
as Professor Kollmann remarks, is a caricature even from the
animal point of view. How much more delicate and refined are a
dog’s or cat’s jaws and teeth in comparison! Unfortunately, while
man is a savage, or when he relapses into brutal habits, it is the
gorilla’s mouth and teeth that his resemble, and not the cat’s or
the dog’s.</p>

<p class='c001'>A small face being therefore a test of refined beauty, we have
here another proof of the superiority of feminine over masculine
beauty. For although woman has a smaller cranium than man, it
is larger than man’s relatively to the face. In other words, women
have smaller and less massive faces than men, both absolutely and
relatively to their size. Kollmann, who is not an evolutionist,
endeavours to account for this difference on the ground that men
are more addicted to the pleasures of the table than women. But
surely, though women eat less than men, they do not make much
less use of their teeth; and for any deficiency in this respect they
more than make up by the constant wagging of their jaws in small-talk.
It is infinitely more probable that Darwin is right in
attributing the massiveness of the masculine jaws to the accumulated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>inherited effects of constant use in fighting with enemies and
rivals—contests from which the passive females have as a rule
been exempt.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is the assumption by the hands of many of the former
functions of the teeth that has led to the decrease in the size of
the teeth, and, in consequence, of the jaw-bones to which they are
attached. Some writers have even claimed that the wisdom-teeth
are becoming rudimentary, and will ultimately disappear, because
there will be no room for them in our gradually diminishing jaws.
We may feel confident, however, that if this reduction in the size
of the jaws tended to go <em>too</em> far, the sense of beauty and Sexual
Selection, <i>i.e.</i> Love, would step in to arrest the process, by favouring
the survival of those who gave their teeth sufficient exercise to
prevent the lower part of the face from becoming too much reduced
in size. Our sense of beauty demands that the distance from tip of
chin to nose should be about the same as the length of the nose
and the height of the forehead. Should these proportions be
violated, Love will restore the balance; for no lover would ever
select a face in which the chin almost touches the nose, as in
infants, whose teeth and jaws are not yet developed, or as in old
men and women, in whom the loss of the teeth has led to a
collapse of the jaws, resulting in a loss of proportion, clumsy movements,
and prognathism.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>DIMPLES IN THE CHIN</h3>

<p class='c013'>An oval, well-rounded chin is one of the most important elements
of formal beauty, and is a characteristic trait of humanity;
for man is the only animal that has a chin. Lavater distinguishes
three principal varieties of chin: the receding chin, which is
peculiar to lower races and types; the chin which does not project
beyond a line dropped from the lips; and the chin which does
project beyond that line. Of all parts of the face the chin has the
least variety of form and capability of emotional expression.
Physiognomists have expended much ingenuity in attempting to
trace a connection between various forms of the chin and traits of
character; but their generalisations have no scientific value. It is
probable that often a very small, weak chin indicates weak desires
and a vacillating character, while an energetic chin, like Richard
Wagner’s, indicates the iron will of a reformer. But the connection
between the development of the brain and special modifications
of the bones of the chin is too remote to permit a safe inference in
individual cases.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>In ancient Egyptian art, as Winckelmann points out, “the chin
is always somewhat small and receding, whereby the oval of the
face becomes imperfect.”</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the most essential conditions of beauty in a chin, if we
may judge by the descriptions of novelists, is a dimple. Yet it is
doubtful whether a dimple can ever be accepted as a special mark
of beauty. Temporary dimples (for the production of which there
seems to be a special muscle) are interesting as a mode of transient
emotional expression. But permanent dimples interrupt the
regular gradation of the beauty-curve, and too often indicate that
the plump roundness, so fascinating in a woman’s face, has passed
the line which indicates corpulence and obliterates the delicate
lines of expression.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dimples occur not only in the chin, but also in the cheek, at
the elbow-joints, on the back, and in plump female hands at the
knuckles. They are caused by a dense tissue of fibres, blood-vessels,
and nerves holding down the skin tightly in one place, and
thus preventing such an accumulation of fat between the skin and
muscles as is seen in the surrounding parts.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tommaseo (quoted by Mantegazza) probably had in mind the
connection between corpulence and mental indolence when he said
that “a dimple in the chin indicates more physical than mental
grace.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“As a dimple—by the Greeks termed νύμφη—is an isolated
and somewhat accidental adjunct to the chin, it was not,” says
Winckelmann, “regarded by the Greek artists as an attribute of
abstract and pure beauty, though it is so considered by modern
writers.” With a few unimportant exceptions, it is not found in
“any beautiful ideal figure which has come down to us.” And
although Varro prettily calls a dimple in a statue of Bathyllus an
impress from the finger of Cupid, Winckelmann thinks that when
dimples do occur in Greek art works they must be attributed to a
conscious deviation from the highest principles of art for the sake
of personal portraiture. “In images whose beauties were of a
lofty cast, the Greek artists never allowed a dimple to break the
uniformity of the chin’s surface. Its beauty, indeed, consists in
the rounded fulness of its arched form, to which the lower lip,
when full, imparts additional size.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>REFINED LIPS</h3>

<p class='c013'>Whereas the beauty of the chin is purely physical, its neighbour,
the mouth, has the emotional charm of expression besides the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>formal beauty of outline. When we come to speak of the ears we
shall find that some animals have five times as many muscles as
man, wherewith they can execute expressive movements with those
organs. But in the number and delicacy of the muscles of the
mouth no animal approaches man, in whom they are more numerous
even than those which serve for the varied expression of the
eyes. Great as is the difference between an animal’s forefoot and
man’s hand, it is not so great as the difference between an animal’s
and a man’s mouth. Chewing and sucking are almost the only
functions of the animal’s mouth, while man moulds his lips into a
thousand shapes in singing, whistling, pouting, blowing, speaking,
smiling, kissing, etc. From being a mere mechanism for masticating
food, it has become the most delicate instrument for intellectual
and emotional expression.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sir Charles Bell’s testimony that “the lips are, of all the
features, the most susceptible of action, and the most direct index of
the feelings,” has already been quoted in the chapter on Kissing.
Could Rubinstein himself express a wider range of emotions, by
subtle variations of pianistic touch, than our lips can express
degrees and varieties of affection in the family, friendly, conjugal,
and love kisses? And can we find, even in the music of Chopin
and Wagner, harmonic changes more infinitely varied than the
countless subtle modulations of the human lips, as revealed in the
fact that deaf mutes can be taught to understand what we say to
them merely by watching the movements of our lips?</p>

<p class='c001'>“The mouth, which is the end of love” (Dante), is also the
seat of Love’s smiles; “and in her smile Love’s image you may
see.” We often read of smiling eyes, and the eyes <em>do</em> partake in
the expression of smiling, by increased brightness and the wrinkling
of the surrounding muscles. But that the mouth is a more
important factor in this expression can be shown by painting the
face of a man with a sad expression, and then pasting on a smiling
mouth, which will give the man at once a happy expression, notwithstanding
the unchanged eyes. In life the muscles of the
mouth and eyes execute certain movements in harmony. “In all
exhilarating emotions,” says Bell, “the eyebrows, the eyelids, the
nostril, and the angle of the mouth are raised. In the depressing
emotions it is the reverse.”</p>

<p class='c001'>For the execution of these diverse movements, which make it
the most expressive organ of the body, the mouth employs more
than a dozen important groups of muscles, some of which originate
in the chin, some in the cheeks, some in the lips themselves,
enabling them to execute independent movements.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>While surpassing the eyes in expressiveness, the mouth rivals
them in beauty of form and colour. “The lips answer the purpose
of displaying a more brilliant red than is to be seen elsewhere,”
says Winckelmann. “The under lips should be fuller than the
upper.” In Greek divinities the lips are not always closed: “and
this is especially the case with Venus, in order that her countenance
may express the languishing softness of desire and love.” At the
same time, “very few of the figures which have been represented
laughing, as some Satyrs or Fauns are, show the teeth.” This is
natural enough, for the long-continued exposure of the teeth would
only result in a grimace. It is only in the transient smile that
the teeth may peep forth; and then what a charming contrast
their ivory curve and lustrous colour presents to the full-blooded,
soft, pink lips!</p>

<p class='c013'>Health, Beauty, and Love—everywhere we see them inseparably
associated. Who could ever fall in love with a pair of thin,
pallid lips that have lost their pink and plump loveliness through
anæmic indolence, or disease, or tight lacing? The very teeth,
though the hardest substance of the body, lose their natural colour
and beauty in ill-health. Not only do they decay and become
blackish, but “in bilious people they become yellow, and in consumptive
patients they show occasionally an unnaturally pearly
and translucent whiteness” (Brinton and Napheys).</p>

<p class='c001'>Negroes have, normally, teeth of a dazzling whiteness, which
is often regarded as a racial peculiarity, but is due, according to
Waitz, to the use of chalk or vegetal fibres. But various savages
are dissatisfied with the natural form and colour of their teeth,
and disfigure them in various ways. “In different countries the
teeth are stained black, red, blue, etc., and in the Malay Archipelago
it is thought shameful to have teeth like those of a dog”
(Darwin).</p>

<p class='c001'>“In Macassar the women spend a part of the day in painting
their teeth red and yellow, in such a way that a red tooth follows
a yellow one, and alternately.” In Japan, Fashion compels
married women to blacken their teeth, not, however, as an ornament,
but to make them ugly and save them from temptation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some African tribes knock out two or more of their front
teeth, on the ground that they do not wish to look like brutes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>The Batokas “think the presence of incisors most unsightly, and on
beholding some Europeans, cried out, ‘Look at the great teeth!’...
In various parts of Africa, and in the Malay Archipelago, the
natives file the incisors into points like those of a saw, or pierce
them with holes, into which they insert studs.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In case of the lips, primitive Fashion prescribes still more
atrocious mutilations. One would think that a negro’s swollen
lips were ugly enough to suit even a devotee of African Fashion;
but no! Her lips being naturally large, the fashionable negro
belle considers it incumbent on her to exaggerate them into
additional hideousness, just as European and American fashionable
women exaggerate the slight and beautiful natural curve of their
waist into the atrocious hour-glass shape.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Among the Babines, who live north of the Columbia River,”
says Sir John Lubbock, “the size of the under lip is the standard
of female beauty. A hole is made in the under lip of the infant,
in which a small bone is inserted; from time to time the bone is
replaced by a larger one, until at last a piece of wood, three inches
long and an inch and a half wide, is inserted in the orifice, which
makes the lip protrude to a frightful extent. The process appears
to be very painful.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In Central Africa,” says Darwin, “the women perforate the
lower lip and wear a crystal, which, from the movement of the
tongue, has ‘a wriggling motion, indescribably ludicrous during
conversation.’ The wife of the chief of Latooka told Sir S. Baker
that Lady Baker ‘would be much improved if she would extract
her four front teeth from the lower jaw, and wear the long pointed
polished crystal in her under lip.’ Further south, with the
Makalolo, the upper lip is perforated, and a large metal and
bamboo ring, called a <em>pelelé</em>, is worn in the hole. This caused the
lip to project in one point two inches beyond the tip of the nose;
and when the lady smiled, the contraction of the muscles elevated
it over the eyes. ‘Why do the women wear these things?’ the
venerable chief Chinsurdi was asked. Evidently surprised at such
a stupid question, he replied, ‘For beauty! They are the only
beautiful things women have; men have beards, women have
none. What kind of a person would she be without a <em>pelelé</em>?
She would not be a woman at all, with a mouth like a man but
no beard.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>In New Zealand, according to Tylor, “it was considered
shameful for a woman not to have her mouth tattooed, for people
would say with disgust, ‘She has red lips.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>Compare these two pictures for a moment: on the one side,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>the protuberant mouth-borders of the negro woman, swollen as by
disease or an insect’s sting, enlarged, in smiling, to the very ears,
and showing not only the teeth but the gums, the tongue and the
unæsthetic &oelig;sophagus; on the other side, the full but delicate
cherry lips of civilised woman, capable of an infinite variety of
subtle, graceful movements, a keyboard on which the whole gamut
of human feelings finds expression, and revealing, in a smile, only
the tips of the pearly, undeformed teeth. Shall we say, with
Alison and Jeffrey, that it is all a matter of taste, and that the
negro has as much right to his taste as we have to ours? Or
have we not plentiful reasons for claiming that Personal Beauty
is a fine art, and that the reason why the negro prefers his coarse
mouth to our refined lips is because he <em>does not understand</em> our
highly-developed and specialised Beauty?</p>

<p class='c001'>There are cogent scientific reasons for believing that, just as
the skull has been modified and developed from the upper part of
the spinal column, and the brain from its contents, so the facial
muscles are all developed from the broad muscle of the neck. In
the orang, according to Professor Owen, we find already all the
important facial muscles which man uses to express emotions.
But, as Darwin remarks, “distinct uses, independently of expression,
can ... be assigned with much probability for almost all
the facial muscles.”</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, the facial muscles “are, as is admitted by
every one who has written on the subject, very variable in
structure; and Moreau remarks that they are hardly alike in half
a dozen subjects. They are also variable in function. Thus the
power of uncovering the canine tooth on one side differs much in
different persons. The power of raising the wings of the nostrils
is also, according to Dr. Piderit, variable in a remarkable degree;
and other such cases could be given.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The facts that the facial muscles blend so much together that
their number has been variously estimated at from nineteen to
fifty-five, and that they vary so much in details of structure and
function in individuals, are of extreme significance. For, in the
first place, this variableness allows Love—or Sexual Selection—to
favour the survival of those modifications of the features which
are most in harmony with the laws of Beauty; and, secondly, it
affords the means of further specialisation and increased accuracy
in the modes of emotional expression.</p>

<p class='c001'>When we see a friend reading a letter, we fancy his face a
perfect mirror, reflecting every mood touched upon in its contents.
Yet many of our expressions are vague, and there is much room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>for improvement in definiteness. Darwin, in the introduction to
his work on the <cite>Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals</cite>,
has remarked how difficult it often is to name the exact emotion
intended to be expressed in a picture of a man, unless we regard
the accessories by which the painter illustrates the situation; and
how apt people are to disagree in naming the emotions expressed
by a series of physiognomic portraits. With monkeys, he says,
“the expression of slight pain, or of any painful emotion, such as
grief, vexation, jealousy, etc., is not easily distinguished from that
of moderate anger.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Savages, as we saw in a previous chapter, are strangers to
many of the tender emotions which enter into our daily life; hence
it would be absurd to look for muscles specially trained to express
them. And even with Europeans the refined emotions are of
such recent development that, as just stated, they are capable of
much further specialisation. To take only one case: it is probable
that, whereas in the present stage of human evolution, it is almost
impossible, without accessories, to distinguish the facial expression
of feminine Romantic Love from that of maternal love, future
generations will have specially modified muscles for those modes of
expression. Duchenne has pointed out on the side of the nose a
series of transient folds expressive of amorous desire. As
Romantic Love displaces coarse passion, may not these or another
set of muscles be pressed into the special service of refined Love
as a sign of encouragement to lovers about to propose? Coquettes,
of course, would immediately cultivate this expression, as a new
wile or “wrinkle.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Between the facial muscles that are thus utilised for the
expression of emotions and other muscles of the body, there is one
difference which is of the utmost importance from the point of
view of Personal Beauty. The function of ordinary muscles is to
move bones, whereas the muscles of expression in the face are
only concerned with the movements of the skin. Hence they do
not enlarge the bones of the face, which would destroy its delicacy.
Their exercise gives elasticity and plump roundness to the outlines
of the face; and as they are subtly subdivided in function, they
cannot easily become too plump from exercise.</p>

<p class='c001'>Individual peculiarities of expression are of course due to the
frequent exercise of certain sets of muscles, leading gradually to a
fixed physiognomic aspect; for form is merely crystallised expression.
Hence no one can be beautiful without being good. Vice
soon destroys Personal Beauty. If the muscles of anger, envy,
jealousy, spite, cruelty, etc., are too frequently called into exercise,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>the result is a face on which the word <em>vicious</em> is written as legibly
and in as many corners as the numerals X and 10 are printed on
a United States banknote.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the reasons why Fashion encourages the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>blasé</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nil admirari</i></span>
attitude, and the stolid suppression of emotional expression,
is to hide these signs of moral and hygienic sins.</p>

<p class='c001'>Oliver Wendell Holmes, anatomist and poet, says of Emerson
that he had “that look of refinement centring about the lips
which is rarely found in the male New Englander, unless the
family features have been for two or three cultivated generations
the battlefield and the playground of varied thoughts and complex
emotions, as well as the sensuous and nutritive port of entry.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr. Holmes need not have limited his generalisation to “male
New Englanders.” Refined mouths are rare in every country,
among women as well as among men. As a writer in the <cite>Victoria
Magazine</cite> exclaims: “It is wonderful how far more common good
foreheads and eyes are amongst us than good mouths and chins.”
Yet there is a special reason for singling out the average male
New Englander as a “warning example.” He inherits the thin,
famished, pale, stern, forbidding lips of his Puritan ancestors,
whose sins are thus visited on later generations. Sins? Yes,
sins against health. Without cheerfulness there can be no sound
health, and the Puritans made the systematic pursuit of unhappiness
the chief object of their life. They made cruel war on all
those innocent pursuits and amusements which bring the bloom of
health and beauty to the youthful cheek, and exercise the lips in
the expression of refined æsthetic emotion. Even music, the most
innocent of the arts, was included in their fanatic ostracism, to
which historians also trace the rarity of musical taste of the highest
order in England.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is reason to believe that it is especially æsthetic culture
which betrays itself in the refined contours and expression of the
lips. Men of genius, though their cast of features is not always
handsome, commonly have finely-cut mouths. Among German
women addicted to music and love of nature, though beauty is
comparatively rare—owing to causes which will be considered in
a later chapter—good mouths are more common than in some
other countries which boast a higher general average of Personal
Beauty. Among Americans in general, all the features are apt to
be finely cut, hence the lips also partake of this advantage.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it is among Spanish maidens that perhaps the most inviting,
full-blooded yet delicate, soft, and refined lips are to be sought.
True, the Spanish maiden seems to lack refined feelings when she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>goes, as commonly supposed, to be thrilled by a bull fight. Yet it
is well known that the upper classes of women in Spain do not
commonly attend these spectacles; and if they did, would they
be more cruel than our fashionable women? Which is the more
glaring evidence of callous emotions, to voluntarily witness the
slaughter of an infuriated, dangerous beast, or to wear on one’s
hat the painted corpses of innocent song-birds?</p>

<p class='c001'>The following passage in one of Washington Irving’s works
shows that the Spanish have genuine æsthetic feeling and taste:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘How near the Sierra looks this evening!’ said Mateo; ‘it
seems as if you could touch it with your hand, and yet it is many
leagues off.’ While he was speaking a star appeared over the
snowy summit of the mountain, the only one yet visible in the
heavens, and so pure, so large, so bright and beautiful as to call
forth ejaculations of delight from honest Mateo.</p>

<p class='c001'>”<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">‘Que lucero hermoso!—que clara y limpio es!—no pueda ser
lucero mas brillante.’</span> (What a beautiful star! how clear and
lucid!—no star could be more brilliant!)</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have often remarked this sensibility of the common people
of Spain to the charms of natural objects. The lustre of a star—the
beauty or fragrance of a flower—the crystal purity of a fountain,
will inspire them with a kind of poetical delight—and then
what euphonious words their magnificent language affords with
which to give utterance to their transports!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Possibly the constant pronouncing of these “euphonious words”
is one of the causes of the beauty of Spanish lips. But one need
not go into such subtle details for an explanation of the phenomenon.
Sexual Selection accounts for it sufficiently. The admiration
of Beauty is the strongest factor in Romantic Love. The
Spaniard’s sense of Beauty is refined through his love of Beauty
in natural objects. Hence in Sexual Selection he is guided by a
taste which abhors equally the coarse, protuberant lips suggestive
of mere animality, and the leathery, lifeless lips indicating neglect
of the laws of health and a lack of lusty vitality. For true labial
refinement consists not in ascetic elimination of sensuous fulness,
but in æsthetic harmony between sense and intellect. The lips,
like all other parts of the body, are naturally plump and full-blooded
in Southern nations, saturated with sunshine and fresh air;
and when this plumpness is checked by mental refinement and the
exigencies of varied expression, then it is that lips become ideally
beautiful.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is with the lips as with Love, of which they are the perch.
Neither Zola nor Dante are the true painters of the romantic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>passion, but Shakspere, who pays respect to flesh and blood as
well as to emotion and intellect.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>COSMETIC HINTS</h3>

<p class='c013'>Although the size and shape of the lips afford an index of
coarse or refined ancestry, the mouth is commonly the most self-made
feature in the countenance, because it is such an important
seat of individual expression. Herein lies a soothing balm to
those who, owing to the stupidly irregular and incalculable laws
of heredity, have inherited an ugly mouth from a grandfather or
a more remote ancestor.</p>

<p class='c001'>A pleasing impression, oft repeated, leaves its traces on the
facial muscles. Kant gives this advice to parents: “Children,
especially girls, must be accustomed early to smile in a frank,
unconstrained manner; for the cheerfulness and animation of the
features gradually leave an impression on the mind itself, and thus
create a disposition towards gaiety, amiableness, and sociability,
which lay an early foundation for the virtue of benevolence.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So Kant evidently believed that we can beautify the soul by
beautifying the body. And the reverse is equally true. As Mr.
Ruskin remarks: “There is not any virtue the exercise of which,
even momentarily, will not impress a new fairness upon the features....
On the gentleness and decision of just feeling there follows a
grace of action which by no discipline may be taught or obtained.”</p>

<p class='c001'>If educators and parents would thoroughly impress on the
minds of the young the great truth that good moral behaviour
and the industry which leads to intellectual pre-eminence are magic
sources of youthful and permanent Personal Beauty, they would find
it the most potent of all civilising agencies, especially with women.</p>

<p class='c001'>Drs. Brinton and Napheys, in their work on <cite>Personal Beauty</cite>
(1870), which is especially valuable from the point of view of
medical and surgical cosmetics, but which is unfortunately out of
print, offer the following suggestions as to how the shape and
expression of the mouth may be improved:—</p>

<p class='c001'>"For cosmetic reasons, immoderate laughter is objectionable.
It keeps the muscles on the stretch, destroys the contour of the
features, and produces wrinkles. It is better to cultivate a
‘classic repose.’</p>

<p class='c001'>"Still more decidedly should the habit of ‘making mouths’
be condemned, whether it occur in conversing in private or to
express emotions. It never adds to the emphasis of the discourse,
never improves the looks, and leads to actual malformations.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>"Children sometimes learn to suck and bite their lips. This
distorts these organs, and unless they are persuaded to give it up
betimes, a permanent deformity will arise.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When the lips have once assumed a given form, it is difficult
to change them. Those that are too thin can occasionally be
increased by adopting the plan of sucking them. This forces a
large quantity of blood to the part, and consequently a greater
amount of nutriment. When too large, compresses can sometimes,
but not always, be used to effect. We have employed silver plates
connected by a wire spring, or a mould of stiff leather. Either
may be worn at night, or in the house during the day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is astonishing to note how many persons are utterly unconcerned
regarding the appearance of their mouths in talking, smiling,
and laughing, sometimes revealing the whole of the teeth and even
the gums, like savages, or as if they were walking tooth-powder
advertisements. Self-observation before a mirror is the best antidote
against such grimaces.</p>

<p class='c001'>Chapped lips sometimes call for constitutional treatment, but
ordinarily they can be easily cured by obtaining a lip-salve of some
reputable chemist. Glycerine is almost always adulterated and
injurious, and should only be used on any part of the skin when
chemically pure.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pale lips are commonly an indication of ill-health, and therefore
call for exercise, tonics, or other medical treatment. And the
colour of the lips is an index of emotion as well as of health—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>That sound teeth, though they should never be seen except in
glimpses, are an extremely important element in facial beauty,
may be seen by the fact that the loss of a few front teeth makes
a person look ten years older at once. The art of dentistry has
reached such marvellous perfection that there is no excuse for
having unsightly teeth. They may be easily preserved to a good
age, if properly exercised on solid food—bread crusts, etc. Very
hot and very cold food and drink is injurious, especially if cold
and hot things are taken in immediate succession. The teeth
should be cleaned twice a day, on rising and before retiring. The
brush should not be too hard, and a harmless powder, wash, or
soap should be obtained of a trustworthy chemist for the threefold
purpose of whitening the teeth by removing tartar, of killing the
numerous microbes in the mouth, and purifying the breath. An
offensive breath is shockingly common, probably owing to the fact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>that many brush only the outside surface of their teeth. They
should be brushed inside as well, and on the top, and the tooth
wash or soap should be brought into contact with every corner
and crevasse of the mouth and teeth. An offensive breath ought
to be good cause for divorce, and certainly it is a deadly enemy of
Romantic Love.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE CHEEKS</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>HIGH CHEEK-BONES</h3>

<p class='c013'>When we look at a Mongolian, the flat nose and oblique eyes
at once attract our attention, but hardly to such a degree as his
high and prominent cheek-bones. The North American Indians,
who are probably the descendants of Mongolians, resemble them
in their prominent cheek-bones; and the Esquimaux likewise
possess these in a most exaggerated form. “The Siamese,” says
Darwin, “have small noses with divergent nostrils, a wide mouth,
rather thick lips, a remarkably large face, with very high and
broad cheek-bones. It is therefore not wonderful that ‘beauty,
according to our notion, is a stranger to them. Yet they consider
their own females to be much more beautiful than those of
Europe.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here is another “matter of taste,” which is decided in our
favour by the general laws of Beauty, positive and negative.</p>

<p class='c001'>High, prominent cheek-bones are ugly, in the first place, because
they interfere with the regularly gradated oval of the face.
Secondly, because, like projecting bones and angles in any other
part of the body, they interrupt the regular curve of Beauty.
Thirdly, because they are coarse and inelegant, offending the sense
of delicacy and grace, like big, clumsy ankles and wrists. Fourthly,
because they suggest the decrepitude of old age and disease.
In the healthy cheek of youth and beauty there is a large
amount of adipose tissue, both under the skin and between the
subjacent muscles. When age or disease makes fatal inroads
on the body, this fat disappears and leaves the impression of
starvation. “Famine is in thy cheeks,” exclaims Shakspere;
and again—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Meagre were his looks,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sharp misery had worn him to the bones.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>When the malar bones are too high, the fleshy cheeks, instead of
including them in a plump curve, are made by contrast to appear
hollow, thus simulating and suggesting the appearance of disease
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>to those whose imagination is sufficiently awake to notice such
suggestions. And besides emaciation, hollow cheeks suggest another
sign of age and decrepitude—the loss of the teeth, which
on the sides of the jaws help to give youthful cheeks their plump
outlines.</p>

<p class='c001'>Finally, prominent cheek-bones are objectionable because they
are concomitants of the large, clumsy, brutal jaws which
characterise savages and apes. To the cheek-bones the upper
jaw-bone is directly attached; hence the larger the teeth are, and
the more vigorously they are exercised in fighting and picking
bones, the more massive must be the cheek-bones, to prevent the
upper jaw from being pushed out of position. Moreover, there is
attached to the cheek-bones a powerful muscle which connects it
with the lower jaw, and by its contraction brings the two jaws
together; and this is a second way in which violent exercise of
the jaws tends to enlarge the cheek-bones, for all bones become
enlarged if the muscles attached to them are much exercised.</p>

<p class='c001'>At a recent meeting of the British Association, Sir George
Campbell advanced the theory that the Aryan race, to which we
belong, originally had prominent cheek-bones, like those of lower
races. On general evolutionary grounds this is indeed a foregone
conclusion; as is the corollary that our cheek-bones have become
smaller, for the same reason that our jaws have become more
delicate; viz. because we no longer use them to fight and tear
our food like wild beasts, but to masticate soft cooked food, to
talk, etc. Thus does the progress of civilisation enhance our
Personal Beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'>An excessive diminution in the size of the cheek-bones, as of
the jaws, will be prevented by Romantic Love (Sexual Selection),
which ever aims at establishing and preserving those proportions
and outlines of the features which are most in harmony with the
general laws of beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the lower animals cruel Natural Selection eliminates
those individuals who are ugly, <i>i.e.</i> unnatural, unhealthy, clumsy.
With mankind charity and pity have checked the operation of
this cruel though beneficial law, and progress in the direction of
refinement and Beauty would therefore be fatally impeded were it
not that Sexual Selection, or Love guided by the sense of Beauty,
steps in to eliminate the ill-favoured, who bear in their countenance
too conspicuously the marks of their savage and animal
ancestry. Perhaps Mr. Wallace had some such thought in his
mind when he anticipated the time when man’s selection shall
have supplanted natural <a id='corr424.43'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='selection'>selection.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_424.43'><ins class='correction' title='selection'>selection.</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>Yet there are thousands of good people who still profess to
believe that “beauty is only skin deep,” and that Romantic Love
and æsthetic culture are of no practical importance, but mere gaudy
soap-bubbles to delight our vision for a transient moment!</p>

<p class='c001'>In future ages, when æsthetic refinement will be more common,
and Romantic Love, its offspring, less impeded by those considerations
of rank and money and imaginary “prudence” which lead
parents to <em>sacrifice the physique and wellbeing of their grand-children</em>
to the illusive comfort of their sons and daughters (in
“marriages of reason”)—what an impetus will then be given to
the development of Personal Beauty! Refined mouths and noses,
rosy cheeks, sparkling eyes, plump and graceful healthy figures,
now so lamentably rare, will then become as plentiful as blackberries
in the autumn.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>COLOUR AND BLUSHES</h3>

<p class='c013'>Although the heart’s warm blood is not carried to the cheeks
in so dense a network of arteries, nor so near the surface as in the
lips, yet the cheeks come next to the lips in delicate sensibility—a
fact which Love has discovered instinctively; for a kiss on the
cheeks is still a kiss of love, whereas a kiss on the forehead or eyelids
indicates less ecstatic forms of affection or esteem.</p>

<p class='c001'>What makes the cheeks so sensitive is the great delicacy of their
transparent skin, which readily allows the colour of the blood to
be seen as through a veil, not only in blushing, but in the natural
rosy aspect of youth and health.</p>

<p class='c001'>Though the cheeks may not vie with the lips and teeth, the
hair and the eyes, in lustrous depth of colour, they have an advantage
in their chamæleonic variety and changes of tint, and their
delicious gradations. Even the delicate blushes on an apple or a
peach, caused by the warm and loving glances of the sun,—what
are they compared to the luscious, mellow tints on a maiden’s ripe
cheeks? Nor is it possible to find in the leaves of an autumnal
American forest more endless individual <em>nuances</em> and shades of red
and rose and pink than in the cheeks of lovely girls—unless indolence
or other sins against health have painted them with
ghastly repulsive pallor, or the hideous Hottentot habit of bedaubing
them with brutal paint has ruined their translucent delicacy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Says the author of the <cite>Ugly Girl Papers</cite>: “Some cheeks have
a winelike, purplish glow, others a transparent saffron tinge, like
yellowish-pink porcelain; others still have clear, pale carmine;
and the rarest of all, that suffused tint like apple-blossoms.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>At summer resorts where girls drink in daily draughts of the
elixir of youth and beauty, commonly known as fresh air, one of
their greatest love-charms is these colour-symphonies on their
cheeks, changing their melody with every pulse-beat. These
charms they might possess all the year round did not their parents
commonly convert their dwelling-houses into hothouses, reeking
with stagnant, enervating air.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, therefore, we read that Africans prefer the opaque, inky,
immutable ebony of their complexion to the translucent, ever-changing
tints, eloquent of health and varied emotions, in a white
maiden’s face, we—well, we simply smile, on recalling the fact
that even among ourselves a cheap, gaudy chromo is preferred by
the great multitude to the work of a great master which they do
not understand. The slow growth of æsthetic refinement is
illustrated by the fact that it is only a few years since Fashion
has set its face against the use of vulgar paints and powders,
which ensure a most questionable temporary advantage at the expense
of future permanent defacement.</p>

<p class='c001'>The colours of the cheeks, so far under consideration, are to a
certain extent subject to our will and skill; for no one who cultivates
the complexion and has plenty of pure air need be without
these blooming buccal roses. But the “thousand <em>blushing apparitions</em>”
that start into our faces are, as Shakspere’s well-chosen
words imply, as independent of our will and control as any other
apparitions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Are blushes ornamental or useful? That is, were they developed
through Sexual or through Natural Selection? Such Shaksperian
expressions as “Bid the cheek be ready with a blush, modest
as morning;” “Thy cheeks blush for pure shame to counterfeit
our roses;” and “To blush and beautify the cheek again,” suggest
the notion that the great poet regarded blushes as beautiful; while
the following permit a different interpretation: “Her blush is guiltiness,
not modesty;” “Blushing cheeks by faults are bred, and fears
by pale white shown;” “You virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must
you be blushing?” “His treasons will sit blushing in his face.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us see if any light is thrown on the problem by going back
to the beginning, and tracing the development of the habit of
blushing. That blushing is a comparatively recent human acquisition
is made apparent from the facts that it is not seen in animals,
nor in very young children, nor in idiots, as a rule; while among
savages the faculty of blushing seems to be dependent on the presence
of a sense of shame, which is almost, if not entirely, unknown
to the lowest tribes.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>That animals never blush, Darwin thinks, is almost certain.
“Blushing,” he says, “is the most peculiar and the most human of
all expressions. Monkeys redden from passion, but it would require
an overwhelming amount of evidence to make us believe that any
animal could blush.” Concerning children he says: “The young
blush much more freely than the old, but not during infancy, which
is remarkable, as we know that infants at a very early age redden
from passion. I have received authentic accounts of two little
girls blushing at the ages of between two and three years; and of
another sensitive child, a year older, blushing when reproved for a
fault.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In the dark-brown Peruvian,” says Mr. Tylor, “or the yet
blacker African, though a hand or a thermometer put to the cheek
will detect the blush by its heat, the somewhat increased depth of
colour is hardly perceptible to the eye.” Dr. Burgess repeatedly
had occasion to observe that a scar in the face of a negress “invariably
became red whenever she was abruptly spoken to, or
charged with any trivial offence.” And Darwin was assured by
several trustworthy observers “that they have seen on the faces of
negroes an appearance resembling a blush, under circumstances
which would have excited one in us, though their skins were of an
ebony-black tint. Some describe it as a blushing brown, but most
say that the blackness becomes more intense.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Now evidence has already been quoted in a previous chapter
showing that negroes admire a black skin more than a white one
(vide <cite>Descent of Man</cite>, 1885, p. 579). Is it likely, therefore, that
the blush was admired by negroes, and became a ground of selection,
because it intensified the blackness of the skin. It hardly seems
probable that the coarse negro can be influenced in his amorous
choice by any such subtle, almost imperceptible difference; and
even the great originator of the theory of Sexual Selection does not
believe that it accounts for the origin of blushes: “No doubt a
slight blush adds to the beauty of a maiden’s face; and the Circassian
women who are capable of blushing invariably fetch a
higher price in the seraglio of the Sultan than less susceptible
women. But the firmest believer in the efficacy of sexual selection
will hardly suppose that blushing was acquired as a sexual ornament.
This view would also be opposed to what has just been
said about the dark-coloured races blushing in an invisible manner.”</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, it seems equally difficult to account for the
origin of blushing on utilitarian grounds. No one likes to be
caught blushing; on the contrary, every one tries to conceal such
a state by lowering or averting the face. How could such an unwelcome,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>embarrassing habit prove of advantage to us? Sir Charles
Bell’s remarks on the subject may serve as a clue to the answer.
That blushing “is a provision for expression may be inferred,” he
says, “from the colour extending only to the surface of the face,
neck, and breast—the parts most exposed.... The colour caused
by blushing gives brilliancy and interest to the expression of the
face. In this we perceive an advantage possessed by the fair
family of mankind, and which must be lost to the dark; for I can
hardly believe that a blush may be seen in the negro.... Blushing
assorts well with youthful and with effeminate features, while
nothing is more hateful than a dog-face that exhibits no token of
sensibility in the variations of colour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The poet Young tells us that “the man that blushes is not
quite a brute;” and Darwin quotes from Humboldt a sneer of the
Spaniard, “How can those be trusted who know not how to
blush?” Darwin’s remark that some idiots, “<em>if not utterly
degraded</em>, are capable of blushing,” also accords with Bell’s notion
that blushing is a provision for expression. Bell’s assertion that it
is “indicative of excitement” is, however, not sufficiently definite.
What is it that a blush expresses? Evidently nervous sensibility,
a moral sense, modesty, innocence. The Circassian who can blush
is more highly valued than another, because the blush is eloquent
of maiden modesty and heart untainted. The fact that there is
also a blush of violated modesty, a blush of shame, and of guilt,
does not argue against this view, any more than the fact that we
blush if, though innocent, we are accused of guilt. It is the
association of ideas and of emotions that evokes the blush in such
cases.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may therefore conclude that a blush is useful on account of
its <em>moral beauty</em>, <i>i.e.</i> its expressiveness of presumptive innocence,
or at least of a desire to be considered innocent; whereas the unblushing
front and cheek indicate a brutal, callous indifference to
virtue. We admire a blush as “the most peculiar and the most
human of all expressions.” And we admire it also, to some extent,
on purely æsthetic grounds, if not exaggerated. A slight blush
has a rosy charm of its own, and it is only when it becomes a too
diffused and deep facial Aurora borealis that it loses its charm,
because suggestive of the hectic or fever flush, or the redness
caused by anger, heat, violent exertion, etc., which has a physiological
origin distinct from that of blushing.</p>

<p class='c001'>According to Bell, “the colour which attends exertion or the
violent passions, as of rage, arises from general vascular excitement,
and differs from blushing. Blushing is too sudden and too partial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>to be traced to the heart’s action.” Darwin endeavours to find the
explanation of blushing in the intimate sympathy which exists
between the capillary circulation of the surface of the head and
face, and that of the brain, which would account for the mental
confusion of shyness, modesty, etc., being so immediately photographed
on the face. He sums up his theory in these words:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“I conclude that blushing—whether due to shyness—to shame
for a real crime—to shame from a breach of the laws of etiquette—to
modesty from humility—to modesty from an indelicacy—depends
in all cases on the same principle; this principle being a
sensitive regard for the opinion, more particularly for the depreciation
of others, primarily in relation to our personal appearance,
especially of our faces; and secondarily, through the force of
association and habit, in relation to the opinion of others on our
conduct.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He gives various illustrations showing how by directing our
attention to certain parts of the body we can increase their sensitivity
and activity in a manner analogous to that postulated by
the theory of blushing. But for these the reader must be referred
to his essay on this subject in the Expression of Emotions—a
masterpiece of physiological and psychological analysis. One more
passage, however, may be cited, as it helps to justify this long discussion
of blushing by showing its special relations to Romantic
Love and Personal Beauty:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is plain to every one that young men and women are highly
sensitive to the opinion of each other with reference to their personal
appearance; and they blush incomparably more in presence of
the opposite sex than in that of their own. A young man, not
very liable to blush, will blush intensely at any slight ridicule of
his appearance from a girl whose judgment on any important
subject he would disregard. No happy pair of young lovers,
valuing each other’s admiration and love more than anything else
in the world, probably ever courted each other without many a
blush. Even the barbarians of Tierra del Fuego, according to Mr.
Bridges, blush ‘chiefly in regard to women, but certainly also at
their own personal appearance.’”</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE EARS</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>A USELESS ORNAMENT</h3>

<p class='c013'>The shell of the ear appears to be the only part of man’s visible
body which has ceased to be useful and become purely ornamental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>“Persons whose ears have been cut off hear just as well as before,”
says Professor Haeckel. Dr. J. Toynbee, F.R.S., “after collecting
all the evidence on this head, concludes that the external shell is
of no distinct use;” and Darwin was informed by Professor
Preyer that after experimenting on the functions of the shell of
the ear he had come to nearly the same conclusion.</p>

<p class='c001'>To infer from this that our external ears have been developed,
through Sexual Selection, for purely ornamental purposes, would
not be in accord with scientific analogies. For, often as existing
organs (horns, feathers, etc.) are <em>modified</em> for ornamental purposes,
there are no known instances of any that have been specially
developed for that purpose; even the facial muscles of expression
being, as we have seen, in this predicament. Hence we are led
to conclude that man has inherited the shell of his ear from a
remote apelike ancestor, to whom it was of use in catching faint
sounds, and who consequently had the power, common to other
animals, not only of directing the ears as a whole to different points
of the compass, but of temporarily altering its shape. Indeed, one
of the strongest proofs of our descent from lower animals lies in
the fact that man still possesses, in a rudimentary form, the
muscles needed to move the ears. Some savage tribes have considerable
control over these muscles. The famous physiologist,
Johannes Müller, after long and patient efforts, succeeded in
recovering the power of moving his ears; and Darwin writes: “I
have seen one man who could draw the whole ear forwards; other
men can draw it upwards; another who could draw it backwards;
and from what one of these persons told me, it is probable that
most of us, by often touching our ears, and thus directing our
attention towards them, could recover some power of movement by
repeated trials.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ordinary monkeys still possess the power to move their ears;
but the manlike or anthropoid apes resemble us in the rudimentary
condition of their ear-muscles; and Darwin was assured by the
keepers in the London Zoological Gardens that these animals never
move or erect their ears. He suggests two theories to account for
the loss of this power: first, that, owing to their arboreal habits
and great strength, these apes were not exposed to much danger,
and thus gradually, through disuse, lost control over these organs,
just as birds on oceanic islands where they are not subject to
attacks have lost the use of their wings; secondly, that the freedom
with which they can move the head in a horizontal plane enabled
them to dispense with mobile ears.</p>

<p class='c001'>The remarkable variability of the ears—greater, by the way, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>men than in women—is another reason for regarding them as
rudimentary organs, inherited from remote semi-human ancestors,
to whom they were useful; for great variability is a characteristic
of all rudimentary organs. Haeckel facetiously suggests that “at
large assemblies, where our interest is not sufficiently enchained,
nothing is more instructive and entertaining than a comparative
study of the countless variations in the form of the ears.” The
ancient Greek artists were aware of this variability, for Wincklemann
speaks of “the infinite variety of forms of the ear on heads
modelled from life.” “It was customary with the ancient artists
to elaborate no portion of the head more diligently than the ears.”
“In portrait figures, when the countenance is so much injured as
not to be recognised, we can occasionally make a correct conjecture
as to the person intended, if it is one of whom we have any
knowledge, merely by the form of the ear; thus we infer a head
of Marcus Aurelius from an ear with an unusually large inner
opening.”</p>

<p class='c001'>If we compare a man’s ears with those of a dog or horse,
differences of shape appear no less conspicuous than differences in
mobility. Two points are especially characteristic of man—the
folded upper margin and the lobule. Our cousins, the anthropoid
apes, are the only other animals which have the margin of the ear thus
folded inwards, the lower monkeys having them simple and pointed,
like other animals. The sculptor, Mr. Woolner, called Darwin’s
attention to “a little blunt point, projecting from the inwardly-folded
margin or helix.” Darwin, on investigating the matter,
came to the conclusion that these points “are vestiges of the tips
of former erect and pointed ears”; being led to think so “from the
frequency of their occurrence, and from the general correspondence
in position with that of the tip of a pointed ear.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The lobule is still more peculiar to man than the folded margin,
since he does not even share it with the anthropoid apes, although,
according to Professor Mivart, “a rudiment of it is found in the
gorilla.” An intermediate stage between man and ape is occupied
by some savage tribes in whom the lobule is scantily developed or
even absent.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>COSMETICS AND FASHION</h3>

<p class='c013'>The lobule of the human ear has been presumably developed
through the agency of Sexual Selection, as it is an ornament the
absence of which is at once felt. And there are other ways in
which this organ has been gradually brought into harmony with
the laws of beauty. Thus the loss of the hair (of which rudiments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>are still occasionally present) made visible the soft skin and the
delicate tint of the ear, which, like that of the cheeks, may be
momentarily heightened by a blush, and thus become an index of
emotional expression. A permanently heightened colour of the ear,
however, caused by exposure to extreme cold or by rough treatment,
is almost as great a blemish as a red nose or pallid lips. If boxers
are anxious to deform their ears, no one has a right to object; but
children have a right to ask of their parents and teachers not to
redden their ears permanently by pulling or boxing them. That a
delicate and important sense-organ like the ear should be so
frequently chosen as a place to inflict punishment, shows the
necessity of a general diffusion of hygienic knowledge. It may not
be superfluous to add a caution to lovers, that the ears should
never be taken as an osculatory substitute for the lips or cheeks,
as cases are known in medical practice where the tympanum, and
consequently the hearing, has been destroyed by a vigorous kiss
implanted by a foolish lover on his sweetheart’s ears.</p>

<p class='c001'>An ear to be beautiful should be about twice as long as broad.
It should be attached to the head almost straight, or slightly
inclined backwards, and should almost touch the head with the
back of its upper point. Many poor girls are deformed for life
through the ignorance of their mothers, who allow them to wear
their hair or bonnets in such a way as to make the ears stand out
obliquely. As the ears contain no bones, but consist entirely of
cartilages and skin, they can be, more readily even than the nose,
moulded into a fine shape at an early age. As Drs. Brinton and
Napheys remark, “Even when the ear is in part or altogether absent,
the case is not desperate. An ‘artificial ear’ can be made of
vulcanised rubber, or other material, tinted the colour of the flesh,
and attached to the side of the head with such deftness that its
character will escape every ordinary eye.” There is therefore no
excuse for having badly-shaped or wrongly-inclined ears in these
days of cosmetic surgery.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the most beautiful ears the lobe is free, and not attached to
the head in its lower part. Heavy earrings, which have a tendency
to unduly enlarge the lobules, are now tabooed by Fashion; but
very small jewels in the ear may be looked on, like small finger-rings,
necklaces, and bracelets, as unobjectionable from an æsthetic
point of view, though real beauty unadorned is adorned the most.</p>

<p class='c001'>Formerly Fashion maltreated the poor ears quite as badly as
it still does the waist and the feet. Lubbock remarks that the
East Islanders enlarge their ears till they come down to the
shoulders; and Darwin, after referring to liberties taken with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>the nose, says that “the ears are everywhere pierced and similarly
ornamented, and with the Botocudos and Lenguas of South America
the hole is gradually so much enlarged that the lower edge touches
the shoulder.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the Greeks, as Becker remarks, "it was considered a
dishonour, or a token of foreign manners, for men to have their ears
bored.... Women and girls, however, not only used earrings,
ἐνώτια, ἐλλόβια, ἑλικτῆρες which are seen perpetually in vases,
but also wore numerous articles of jewellery about the neck, the
arms, and on the leg above the ankle."</p>

<p class='c001'>The ancients, too, had heard of the malformed ears of primitive
peoples. “It is possible,” says Tylor, “that there may be some
truth in the favourite wonder-tale of the old geographers, about the
tribes whose great ears reached down to their shoulders, though
the story had to be stretched a good deal when it was declared
they lay down on one ear and covered themselves with the other
for a blanket.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Such blanket-ears would be the æsthetic equivalent of modern
bustles, crinolettes, and wasp-waists.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>PHYSIOGNOMIC VAGARIES</h3>

<p class='c013'>Ever since the days of ancient Greek philosophy ingenious
attempts have been made to find a special meaning for this or that
particular form of the ear. According to Aristotle, a long ear
indicates a good memory, whereas modern physiognomists incline
to the opinion that a long ear shows a man’s mental relationship
to a certain unjustly-maligned animal. Small ears, Lavater thinks,
are a sign of an active mind, while a deep shell indicates a thirst
for knowledge.</p>

<p class='c001'>As a matter of fact, the ears have no connection whatever with
intellectual or emotional expression, except that a well-shaped ear
indicates in a general way that its possessor comes off a stock in
which the laws of cosmetic hygiene have been observed during
many generations. To many of the lower animals the ears are a
means of emotional expression. What, for instance, could be more
expressive and droll than the way a dog expresses mild surprise or
expectation by pricking up his ears? Or what a more certain
sign of viciousness in a horse than the drawing back of the ears?—a
movement of which Darwin has found the reason in the fact
that all animals that fight with their teeth retract their ears to
protect them; whence, through habit and association, it comes
that they draw them back whenever a fighting mood comes over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>them. Man, on the other hand, never uses his ears for emotional
expression, because they are the least mobile part of the body.
Now form is merely crystallised expression: and the absence of
special movements for emotional expression necessarily prevents
individual alterations indicative of character. Hence the absurdity
of trying to use the ears as a basis for physiognomic distinctions.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>NOISE AND CIVILISATION</h3>

<p class='c013'>What is the cause of the folding of the margin of the human
ear, which distinguishes it from that of all other animals? Darwin
remarks that it “appears to be in some manner connected with the
whole external ear being permanently pressed backwards;” but
this does not explain the mysterious phenomenon. After many
hours of profound meditation on this subject I have come to the
conclusion that this slight folding of the ear’s margin is the beginning
of a new phase of human evolution. In course of time—this
cannot be disproved—the fold of the margin will become larger
and larger, until finally the shells of the ear will have been transformed
into mobile lids for shutting out at will disagreeable noises,
even as the eyelids have been developed to shut out glaring light.
This would account for the providential preservation of the rudimentary
ear-muscles referred to above. When this process of
evolution is completed men coming home late will no longer have
to listen to curtain-lectures. The innovation will tend to make
them polite, for instead of telling the lecturer to “shut up,” they
will shut up themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>Seriously speaking, such movable ear-lids are very much needed
in this transition stage of civilisation. The present age of steam
will by future historians be classified as the age of noise. It is
almost impossible to find a place within ten miles of a city where
one can rest without having one’s sleep constantly disturbed, or at
least <em>deprived of its refreshing depth</em>, by the blowing of railway
and factory whistles. Both are unnecessary, inasmuch as railway
signals would be quite as effective if not so murderously loud and
prolonged, while factory whistles are either blown at the moment
when the operatives go to work, when a simple bell would do as
well, or they are blown an hour earlier to wake up the workmen,—a
most outrageous proceeding, as everybody else sleeping within
a radius of a mile or more is thus waked up at six o’clock.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fact that these nuisances have so long been tolerated shows
how primitive is as yet the æsthetic development of the average
human ear. Some people even smile at you for being so “nervous,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>and boast of their indifference to such hideous, brain-racking noises.
The Esquimaux and Chinese would doubtless assume a similar
attitude regarding their indifference to noisome stenches. In
mediæval times, Europeans in general were quite as indifferent to
the emanations from their gutters as they still are to the hideous
noises in the streets. It has often been noted with surprise that
the death-rate in London and the general aspect of health should
be so much more favourable than that of continental cities, which
are free from the depressing London fogs. The reason, doubtless,
lies chiefly in the facts that there are no vile sewer odours in
London to poison the atmosphere, and that the pavement of the
streets is of such a nature that one can sleep soundly at night,
provided there are no steam whistles near. London, too, does not
tolerate the brutal whip-cracking which transforms French, German,
and Swiss towns and cities into Bedlams of noise. In this respect
New York resembles London; but here the comparison ends. New
York pavements are the noisiest, roughest, and dirtiest in the
world. I have known of invalids who were advised to drive in
the Central Park, but could not do so because they could not bear
on their way to drive even up Fifth Avenue,—a street lined with
the houses of millionaires. And to walk on Broadway for twenty
minutes, talking to a friend, makes one as hoarse as delivering a
two-hour lecture.</p>

<p class='c001'>There can be no doubt that a horror of useless noise grows with
the general refinement of the senses and the mind. Goethe’s
aversion to noise, especially at night, is well known. It led him
to poison dogs that disturbed him. The delicate hearing of Franz,
the great song composer, was ruined by the whistle of a locomotive.
And Schopenhauer has put the whole matter into a nutshell in
these admirable words: “Intellectual persons, and all in general
who have much <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>esprit</i></span>, cannot endure noise. Astounding, on the
other hand, is the insensibility of ordinary people to noise. The
quantity of noise which any one can endure without annoyance is
really related inversely to his mental endowments, and may be
regarded as a pretty accurate measure of them.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>A MUSICAL VOICE</h3>

<p class='c013'>It is self-evident that indifference to ear-splitting noises implies
a lack of appreciation for the exquisite clang-tints of music; for
whenever the acoustic nerve is sufficiently refined to appreciate
such subtle tints, it is affected as painfully by harsh sounds as the
artistic eye is by glaring colours and flickering light. And an ear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>which is indifferent to the sweetness of musical sounds is of course
indifferent also to the musical charm of the speaking voice. But
a sweetly modulated voice is one of the most conspicuous attributes
of Personal Beauty—for Beauty refers to sounds as well as to
sights—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>“Her voice was ever soft,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gentle and low, an excellent thing in woman.”—<span class='sc'>Shakspere.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There is as much variety in voices as in faces; and in estimating
a person’s general refinement, the voice is perhaps a safer guide
than the face; because the quality of the voice is largely a matter
of individual training, whereas in reading faces the judgment is
warped by the presence of inherited features speaking of traits
which have not been modified by individual effort and culture.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many young men and women live in absolute indifference to the
quality of their speaking voice, till one day Cupid arouses them
from their unæsthetic slumber with his golden arrows, and makes
them eager not only to brush up their hats and improve their
personal appearance, but also to modulate their voices into sweet,
expressive accents. But the vocal cords, like a violin, can only be
made to yield mellow sounds after long practice; hence the usual
result of a sudden effort to speak in love’s sweet accents is a
ridiculous lover’s falsetto.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE NOSE</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>SHAPE AND SIZE</h3>

<p class='c013'>“The fate of innumerable girls has been decided by a slight
upward or downward curvature of the nose,” says Schopenhauer;
and Pascal points out that if Cleopatra’s nose had been but a trifle
larger, the whole political geography of this planet might have
been different. Owing to the fact that the nose occupies the most
prominent part of the face, Professor Kollmann remarks that “the
partial or complete loss of the nose causes a greater disfigurement
than a much greater fault of conformation in any other part of the
face.” And Winckelmann thus bears witness to the importance
of the nose as an element of Personal Beauty: “The proof, easy
to be understood, of the superiority of shape of the Greeks and the
present inhabitants of the Levant lies in the fact that we find
among them no flattened noses, which are the greatest disfigurement
of the face.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet here again we find that “tastes differ.” Thus we read in
Darwin “that the ancient Huns during the age of Attila were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>accustomed to flatten the noses of their infants with bandages, ‘for
the sake of <em>exaggerating a natural conformation</em>’” [note the stamp
of Fashion]; that, “with the Tahitians, to be called <em>long-nose</em> is
considered as an insult, and they compress the noses and foreheads
of their children for the sake of beauty;” and that “the
same holds true with the Malays of Sumatra, the Hottentots,
certain Negroes, and the natives of Brazil.” But the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ne-plus-ultra</i></span>
of nasal ugliness is found among the Tartars and Esquimaux.
“European travellers in Tartary in the Middle Ages,” says Tylor,
“described its flat-nosed inhabitants as having no noses at all, but
breathing through holes in the face.” And among the Esquimaux,
as Mantegazza remarks, a rule can be placed on both the cheeks
at once without touching the nose. Flat noses, says Topinard,
“are either depressed as a whole, as among Chinese, or only in
the lower half, as among Malays. Negroes have both forms.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The yellow and black races, who naturally have flat noses,
consider it fashionable to have them <em>very</em> flat. The same is true
with our modern Fashion regarding wasp-waists and feet. But in
regard to the face the white races—including even the women—have
emancipated themselves from the tyranny of fashionable
exaggeration. Hence, though we admire prominent noses, we do
not admire them more and more in proportion to their size. On
the contrary, every one looks upon the very large Jewish nose as
ugly. The reason is that in judging of the face Fashion has been
displaced by æsthetic Taste, whose motto is Moderation, and which
is based on a knowledge of the cosmic laws of beauty. Savages
have Fashion but no Taste. We have both; but Taste is
gradually demolishing Fashion, like other relics of barbarism.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sometimes our estimate of the nose, as of other features, may
be influenced by non-æsthetic considerations—by prejudices of
race, aristocracy, etc. “In Italy,” says Mantegazza, “we call a
long nose aristocratic (especially if it is aquiline) perhaps because
conquerors with long noses, Greeks and Romans, have subjected
the indigenous small-nosed inhabitants.” But the Italians are
not the only people who, if asked to choose between a nose too
large or one too small, would ask for the former. And the cause
of this preference is suggested very forcibly in these remarks of
Grose: “Convex faces, prominent features, and large aquiline
noses, though differing much from beauty, still give an air of
dignity to their owners; whereas concave faces, flat, snub, or
broken noses, always stamp a meanness and vulgarity. <em>The one
seems to have passed through the limits of beauty, the other never
to have arrived at them.</em>”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>EVOLUTION OF THE NOSE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The flat, irregular nose of savages and semi-civilised peoples,
with its visible nostrils and imperfectly developed bridge, being
intermediate between the ape’s nose and our own, we are naturally
led to infer that the nose has been gradually developed into the
shape now regarded as most perfect by good judges of Beauty.
To what are we indebted for this favourable change—to Natural
or to Sexual Selection? In other words, is the present perfected
shape of the nose of any use to us, or is it purely ornamental?</p>

<p class='c001'>It appears that both these laws have acted in subtle combination
to improve our nasal organ. The nose is a sort of funnel for
warming the air on its way to the sensitive lungs. In cold latitudes
a long nose would therefore be an advantage favoured by
Natural Selection; and it is noteworthy that in general the flat-nosed
peoples live in warm climes. There are exceptions, however,
notably the Esquimaux, showing that this hypothesis does not
entirely cover the facts.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us examine, therefore, the second function of the nasal
organ. The external nose is a sort of filter for keeping organic
impurities out of the lungs. At the entrance of the nostrils there
are a number of fine hairs which serve to keep out the dust. If
any particles manage to get beyond this first fortress, they are
liable to be arrested by the rows of more minute, microscopic
hairs, or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cilia</i></span>, which line the mucous membrane and keep up a
constant downward movement, by means of which dusty intruders
are expelled and the air filtered. Esquimaux living in snowfields,
and savages in the forests and grass-carpeted meadows, do not
need these filters so much as we do in our dusty cities and along
dusty country roads; hence their noses have remained more like
those of the arboreal apes, while ours have grown larger, so as to
yield a larger surface of sifting hairs and cilia. When we think
of the dusty American prairies and the African and Asian deserts,
can we wonder, accordingly, that the American Indians, as well as
the nomadic Arabs and Jews, have such immense noses? The
theory seems fanciful, if not grotesque; but perhaps there is more
in it than appears at first sight.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even if both these hypotheses should prove untenable, there is
a third consideration which alone suffices to account for the development
of the European nose. The nose has a most important
<em>musico-philological</em> function. The language of savages often consists
of only a few hundred words, while ours is so complicated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>that it requires the co-operation of the vocal cords, and the cavities
of the mouth and the nose to produce the countless modifications
of speech and song which make us listen with so much pleasure to
an eloquent speaker or a great singer. The subject is far too
complicated with anatomical details to be fully explained here,
and the reader must be referred to a full discussion (not from the
evolutionary point of view, however) to Professor Georg Hermann
von Meyer’s elaborate treatise on <cite>The Organs of Speech</cite>, chap. iii.</p>

<p class='c001'>A few points, however, must be noted here. The nasal air-passage,
“with its two narrow openings and intermediate greater
width, possesses the general form of a resonator, and there can be
no doubt but that it has a corresponding influence, and that the
tones with which the air passing through it vibrates are strengthened
by its resonance. The larger the nasal cavity the more
powerful the resonance, and, consequently, the reinforcement experienced
by the tone.... In consequence of the peculiarity of
the walls of the nasal cavity, it appears that sounds uttered with
the nasal resonance, particularly the nasal vowels, are fuller and
more ample than the same sounds when strengthened by the
resonance of the cavity of the mouth. The general impression of
fulness and richness conveyed by the French language arises from
its wealth in nasal vowels; and it is for this reason that second-rate
tragic actors like to give a nasal resonance to all the vowels
in the pathetic speeches of their heroic parts.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Further, it is of great importance to bear in mind “<em>that the
resonance of the nasal cavity also plays a part in the formation of
non-nasal articulate sounds,</em>” appearing here as a mere reinforcement
of the resonance of the cavity of the mouth, and free from
the nasal twang. Indeed, paradoxical as it may seem, an infallible
way to make our speech sound “nasal” is to keep the air out of
the nose by clasping it tightly; whereas if the nasal passage
remains open the nasal twang is replaced by an agreeable resonance.
What could more forcibly illustrate the importance of a
well-developed nose?</p>

<p class='c001'>Now there are several groups of muscles attached to the lower
cartilages of the nose,—parts which are imperfectly developed in
apes and negroes. The constant exercise of these, during many
generations, in the service of speech, in expressing several emotions,
and in heavy breathing, suffice to account, on accepted physiological
principles, for the gradual enlargement of the resonant tube
which we call the nose.</p>

<p class='c001'>So much for Natural or Utilitarian Selection. But Sexual
Selection or Romantic Love plays also a most important <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span> in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>the development of the nose. The quotations from Pascal and
Schopenhauer made at the beginning of this chapter show that
the efficacy of Sexual Selection was recognised long before Darwin
had coined the term. As soon as a refined æsthetic taste appears,
it rejects ugly forms of the nose. It rejects, for instance, open,
visible nostrils, because they are a scavenging apparatus, unæsthetic
to behold, though the savage, having no taste, is not thus offended.
It gives the preference, in the second place, to the long nose, on
musical grounds, because its owner has a more sonorous speech.
It scorns the snub-nose because of its simian suggestiveness, and
dislikes the excessively large and aquiline nose because it is an
exaggerated form, which has passed beyond the delicate dimensions
and subtle curves of beauty.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>GREEK AND HEBREW NOSES</h3>

<p class='c013'>This checking of excessive development in the direction at first
prescribed by the cosmic laws of beauty is indeed one of the main
functions of Sexual Selection, without which our mouths would
gradually become too small, our eyes and noses too large, our
foreheads too high, our hair too scant, etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>Why, for instance, have the Jews such large noses compared
with the Greeks? Evidently because Taste—which, though commonly
associated with Romantic Love, may, in a highly æsthetic
nation, act independently of it—did not restrain the excessive
development of the Jewish nose. The ancient Hebrews were not
an æsthetic nation, like the Greeks. The finest works of sculpture
ever created were made by the Greeks, while the Hebrews
practically had no sculpture at all—not even such works as were
produced by Assyrians and Egyptians. And if any further proof
were needed of the statement that the ancient Hebrews had little
taste for beauty it might be found in the fact that Solomon,
esteemed a great judge of feminine charms, compares his love’s
nose to “the tower of Lebanon, which looketh toward Damascus.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The admission which I have just made that there may be a
sort of æsthetic selection independent of real Romantic Love, does
not militate against the general thesis of this book: that Love is
the cause of Beauty, as Beauty is the cause of Love. For though
the Greek artists knew what the shape and size of a beautiful
nose should be, there are cogent reasons for believing that “Greek
noses” were rare even among the ancient Greeks, thanks to their
habit of sacrificing Romantic Love to the dragon chaperon. Hear
what Ruskin has to say, in his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Aratra Pentelici</i></span>, about the Greek
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>features in general: “Will you look again at the series of coins of
the best time of Greek art which I have just set before you?
Are any of these goddesses or nymphs very beautiful? Certainly
the Junos are not. Certainly the Demeters are not. The Siren
and Arethusa have well-formed and regular features; but I am
quite sure that if you look at them without prejudice, you will
think neither reaches even the average standard of pretty English
girls. The Venus Urania suggests at first the idea of a very
charming person, but you will find there is no real depth nor
sweetness in the contours, looked at closely. And remember,
these are chosen examples; the best I can find of art current in
Greece at the great time; and even if I were to take the celebrated
statues, of which only two or three are extant, not one of
them excels the Venus of Melos; and she, as I have already
asserted in <cite>The Queen of the Air</cite>, has nothing notable in feature
except dignity and simplicity. Of Athena I do not know one
authentic type of great beauty; but the intense ugliness which
the Greeks could tolerate in their symbolism of her will be convincingly
proved to you by the coin represented in Plate VI.
You need only look at two or three vases of the best time to
assure yourselves that beauty of feature was, in popular art, not
only unattained, but unattempted; and finally—and this you
may accept as a conclusive proof of the Greek insensitiveness to
the most subtle beauty—there is little evidence, even in their
literature, and none in their art, of their having ever perceived
any beauty in infancy or early childhood.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless, it was to the contours of childhood that the
Greek artists apparently went for their ideal of the divine nose.
Greek beauty was youthful masculine beauty; and the “Greek
nose” is one which not only is straight in itself, but forms a
straight line with the forehead. In other words, there is no
hollow at the root of the nose, where it meets the forehead.
Now the absence of this cavity is characteristic of youth, and is
owing to the imperfect development of the brain cavities. Later
in life these cavities bulge forwards and produce the hollow,
which, therefore, is an indication of superior cranial development
and higher intellectual powers. Hence, as Professor Kollmann
suggests, the object of the Greek artists in making the nose of
their deities form a straight line with the forehead, was probably
to give them the stamp of eternal youth; which would thus
appear to have been considered a more important attribute even
than the expression of superior <em>masculine</em> intellectual power,
which we associate with the hollow at the junction of nose and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>forehead, and for which reason we do not admire it in women if
too pronounced. Nevertheless, even in women the cosmic laws of
Beauty call for a gentle curve instead of a perfectly straight line;
but the more subtle the curve the greater is its beauty; whereas
the nose itself may be perfectly straight on its upper edge, because
it forms a dividing line of the face into two symmetric halves, and
by its contrasting straightness heightens the beauty of the surrounding
facial curves.</p>

<p class='c001'>To sum up: the Greeks admiration of such features as are
naturally associated with youthful masculine beauty no doubt led
him, in choosing a wife, to give the preference to similar features,
including the “Greek” nose. Yet in the absence of opportunities
for courtship, Sexual Selection could not operate very extensively;
hence it is probable that ungainly noses, though not so extravagant
as among the Semitic races, were common enough in Greece as in
Rome. In the Dark Ages hideous noses must have prevailed
everywhere, as might be inferred from the facts that Romantic
Love was unknown, and physical beauty looked on as a sinful
possession, even if the painted and sculptured portraits did not
prove it to our eyes in most instances.</p>

<p class='c001'>Regarding modern noses it may be said that the nose is such a
prominent feature that more has been done for its improvement,
through the agency of Love or Sexual Selection, than for the
mouth or any other feature, excepting the eye. The average
Englishman’s nose of to-day, for example, is a tolerably shapely
organ, and yet his ancestors were not exactly distinguished for
nasal beauty, according to a close observer and student of portraiture,
Mr. G. A. Simcox, who remarks that “sometimes both
Danes and Saxons had their fair proportions of snub-noses and
pug-noses, but when they escaped that catastrophe the Danish
nose tended to be a beak (rather a hawk’s beak than an eagle’s),
while the Saxon nose tends to be a proboscis.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet even at this date perfect noses are rare, and it is easy to
see why. In the first place, it takes many generations to wipe
out entirely the ugliness inherited from our unæsthetic ancestors;
secondly, Romantic Love, based on æsthetic admiration, is still
very commonly ignored in the marriage market in favour of
considerations of rank and wealth; and thirdly, a lover, infatuated
by his sweetheart’s fascinating eyes, is apt to overlook her large
nose or mouth—till after the honeymoon.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>FASHION AND COSMETIC SURGERY</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Inasmuch as the civilised races of Europe have so long been
indifferent to their ugly noses, we can hardly wonder that barbarians
should not only disregard their nasal caricatures, but even
exaggerate their grotesqueness deliberately. We have already
seen how certain tribes habitually flatten their already flat noses.
Moreover, “in all quarters of the world the septum, and more
rarely the wings, of the nose are pierced; rings, sticks, feathers,
and other ornaments being inserted into the holes.” “In Persia
one still finds the nose-ring through one side of a woman’s nostril;”
and Professor Flower states that such rings are often worn by
female servants who accompany English families returning from
India.</p>

<p class='c001'>Captain Cook, in the account of his first voyage, says of the
east-coast Australians: “Their principal ornament is the bone
which they thrust through the cartilage which divides the nostrils
from each other.... As this bone is as thick as a man’s finger,
and between five and six inches long, it reaches quite across the
face, and so effectually stops up both the nostrils that they are
forced to keep their mouths wide open for breath, and snuffle so
when they attempt to speak that they are scarcely intelligible
even to each other.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This last sentence bears out our assertion regarding the philological
or conversational importance of the nose. And there is
another lesson to be learned from these barbarian mutilations of
the nose. If Huns, Tahitians, and Hottentots are able to make
their noses as delightfully ugly as they please, why should not we
utilise the plastic character of the nasal cartilages for beautifying
ourselves? Says a specialist: “Much can be done by an ingenious
surgeon in restoration and improvement. A nose that is too flat
can be raised, one with unequal apertures can be modified, one too
thin can be expanded. Cosmetic surgery is rich in devices here,
all of which are very available in children and young persons, less
so when years have hardened and stiffened the cartilages and bones.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus may Cupid employ a medical artist as an assistant in his
efforts at improving the physical beauty of mankind. Needless to
add that only a first-class surgeon should ever be allowed to
meddle with the features.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cosmetic surgery has already reached such perfection that it
can even make “a good, living, fleshly nose. It will transplant
you one from the arm or the forehead, Roman or Grecian, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>à
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>volonté</i></span>; it will graft it adroitly into the middle of the face, with
two regular nostrils and a handsome bridge; and it will almost
challenge Nature herself to improve on the model” (Brinton and
Napheys).</p>

<p class='c001'>Medical men are daily complaining in a more clamorous chorus
that their profession is overcrowded. Why don’t some of them in
every city and town make a specialty of cosmetic surgery and
hygienic advice? Why leave this remunerative field entirely in
the hands of dangerous quacks who alone have enterprise and
sense enough to advertise?</p>

<p class='c001'>As illustrations of what may be done in this direction, two
points may be noted. A French surgeon, Dr. Cid, noticed that
persons who wear eyeglasses are apt to have long and thin noses.
The thought occurred to him that this might be due to the compression
of the arteries which carry blood to the nose, by the
springs of the glasses; so he constructed a special apparatus for
compressing these arteries, and by attaching it to a young girl’s
large and fleshy nose, succeeded in reducing its size. Why should
people worry themselves and frighten others with ugly noses when
they can be so easily improved?</p>

<p class='c001'>The second point is still more simple. It is important that
the nose should occupy exactly the middle of the face, so as to
secure bilateral symmetry. Yet Welcker, who made a number of
accurate observations on skulls, plaster casts of the dead, as well
as on the living countenance, noted that perfect symmetry is very
rarely found. The obliqueness is sometimes at the root, sometimes
at the tip of the nose, and the cause of the deviation from a
straight line is attributed to the habit most persons have of
sleeping exclusively on one side,—a practice which is also objectionable
on other grounds. Mantegazza, however, suggests that,
as he has found the deviation almost always toward the right side,
it may be due to our habit of always taking our handkerchief in
the right hand; and the same view is held by Drs. Brinton and
Napheys. So that we have here an additional argument in favour
of ambidexterity.</p>

<p class='c001'>The New York <cite>Medical and Surgical Reporter</cite> for November
1, 1884, prints a lecture by Dr. J. B. Roberts on “The Cure of
Crooked Noses by a New Method,” which, as it is not conspicuous
and hardly leaves a scar, may be commended to the attention of
those afflicted with nasal deformities. The pin method, he says,
is applicable “even to those slight deformities whose chief annoyance
is an æsthetic and cosmetic one. I leave the pins in position
for about two weeks.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>Red noses, if due to exposure, can be readily whitened by one
of the methods to be discussed in the chapter on the complexion.
If due to disease, they call for medical treatment; if to intemperance
or tight lacing, moral and æsthetic reform is the only possible
cure.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>NOSE-BREATHING AND HEALTH</h3>

<p class='c013'>Owing to its tendency toward unsightly redness and malformation,
the nose is very apt to be looked at from a comic point of
view. Wits and caricaturists fix on it habitually for their
nefarious purposes, as if it were a sort of facial clown. Indeed,
ninety-nine persons in a hundred, if questioned regarding the
functions of the nose, would know no answer but this: that it is
sometimes ornamental, and is remotely connected with the
“almost useless” sense of smell.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have seen, however, that besides being ornamental <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per se</i></span>,
the nose plays a most important æsthetic—as well as utilitarian—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span>
in giving sonority and variety to human speech; and that it
is, further, of great use as an apparatus for warming, moistening,
and filtering the air before it enters the lungs. Hence the importance
of nose-breathing. Professor Reclam states that city
people at the age of thirty usually have <em>a whole gramme of calcareous
dust in their lungs</em>, which they can never again get rid of,
and which may at any time engender dangerous disease. This is
one of the bad results of mouth-breathing, but by no means the
only one. “The continued irritation from dry, cold, and unfiltered
air upon the mucous membrane of the upper air tract soon results,”
says Dr. T. R. French, “in the establishment of catarrhal inflammation,
the parts most affected being the tongue, pharynx, and
larynx.... The habit of breathing through the mouth interferes
with general nutrition. The subjects of this habit are usually
anæmic, spare, and dyspeptic.”</p>

<p class='c001'>That mouth-breathing at night leaves a disagreeable taste in
the mouth and leads to snoring, thus interfering with refreshing
sleep, has already been stated. It also injures the teeth and gums
by exposing them all night to the dry air. And in the daytime it
compels one to keep the mouth wide open, which imparts a rustic if
not semi-idiotic expression to the face. Moreover, think of the filthy
dust you swallow in walking along the street with your mouth open.
However, it is useless to advise people on such matters. An
attempt is made for a day or two to reform, and then—the whole
matter is forgotten. These points are therefore noted here not with
any missionary intentions, but merely for their scientific interest.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>COSMETIC VALUE OF ODOURS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We come now to the fourth important function of the nose—the
sense of smell. What has this to do with Personal Beauty?
A great deal. In the first place, is not the flower-like fragrance
of a lovely maiden a personal charm that has been sung of by a
thousand poets, of all times? “The fragrant bosom of Andromache
and of Aphrodite finds a place in Homer’s poetry,” as Professor
Bain remarks; and an eccentric German professor, Dr. Jäger of
Stuttgart, even wrote a book a few years ago on the <cite>Discovery of
the Soul</cite>, in which he endeavoured to prove that the whole mystery
of Love lies in the intoxicating personal perfumes.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not with such fancies, however, that we are concerned
here. It can be shown on purely scientific grounds that the cause
of Personal Beauty would gain an immense advantage if people
would train and refine their olfactory nerves systematically, as
they do their eyes and ears. Unfortunately, Kant’s absurd notion,
expressed a century ago, that it is not worth while to cultivate
the sense of smell, has been countenanced to the present day by
the erroneous views held by the leading men of science, including
Darwin, who wrote that “the sense of smell is of extremely slight
service” to man.</p>

<p class='c001'>In an article on the “Gastronomic Value of Odours,” which
appeared in the <cite>Contemporary Review</cite> for November 1886, I
pointed out that this under-valuation of the sense of smell is
explained by the fact that the sense of taste has hitherto been
credited with all the countless flavours inherent in food, whereas,
in fact, taste includes only four sensations of gastronomic value—sweet,
sour, bitter, and saline, all other “flavours” being in reality
odours; as is proved by the fact that by clasping the nose we
cannot distinguish between a lime and a lemon, different kinds of
confectionery, of cheese, of nuts, of meat, etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now it is well known that most people show a most amazing
tolerance to insipid, badly-cooked food, gulping it down as rapidly
as possible; and why? Simply because they do not know that in
order to enjoy our meals we must eat slowly, and, while masticating,
<em>continually exhale the aroma-laden air through the nose</em>
(mind, not inhale but <em>exhale</em>). This is what epicures do unconsciously;
and look at the results! No dyspepsia, no anæmia and
sickly pallor, no walking skeletons;—and surely a slight <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>embonpoint</i></span>
is preferable to leanness from the point of view of Personal
Beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>If this gastronomic secret were generally known, people would
insist on having better cooked food; dyspepsia, and leanness, and
a thousand infirmities hostile to Beauty would disappear, and in
course of time everybody would be as sleek and handsome and
rosy-cheeked as a professional epicure.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor is this the only way in which refinement of the sense of
smell would benefit Personal Beauty. In consequence of the
criminally superstitious dread of night air, the atmosphere in
most bedrooms is as foul, compared to fresh air, as a street puddle
after a shower compared to a mountain brook. I have seen well-dressed
persons in America and Italy take into their mouths the
shamefully filthy and disease-soaked banknotes current in those
countries; and I have seen others shudder at this sight who, if
their smell were as refined as their sight, would have shuddered
equally at the foul air in their bedrooms, which diminishes their
vital energy and working power by one-half. Architects, of course,
will make no provision for proper ventilation as long as they are
not compelled to do so. Why should they? They don’t even
care, in building a theatre, how many hundreds of people will
some day be burnt in it, in consequence of their neglect of the
simplest precautions for exit.</p>

<p class='c001'>One more important consideration. When you leave the city
for a few weeks everybody will exclaim on your return, “Why,
how well you look! where have you been?” But wherein lies
this cosmetic magic of country air? Not in its oxygen, for it has
been proved, by accurate chemical tests, that in regard to the
quantity of oxygen there is not the slightest difference between
city and country air. What, then, is the secret?</p>

<p class='c001'>I am convinced, from numerous experiments, that the value of
country air lies partly in its tonic fragrance, partly in the <em>absence
of depressing, foul odours</em>. The great cosmetic and hygienic
value of deep-breathing has been proved in the chapter on the
Chest. Now the tonic value of fragrant meadow or forest air lies
in this—that it causes us involuntarily to breathe deeply, in order
to drink in as many mouthfuls of this luscious aerial Tokay as
possible: whereas in the city the air is—well, say unfragrant and
uninviting; and the constant fear of gulping down a pint of deadly
sewer gas discourages deep breathing. The general pallor and
nervousness of New York people have often been noted. The
cause is obvious. New York has the dirtiest streets of any city
in the world, except Constantinople and Canton; and, moreover,
it is surrounded by oil-refineries, which sometimes for days poison
the whole city with the stifling fumes of petroleum, so that one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>hardly dares to breathe at all. No wonder that, by universal
consent, there is more Fashion than Beauty in New York. And
no wonder that it is becoming more and more customary, for all
who can afford it, to spend six to eight months of the year in the
country.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE FOREHEAD</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>BEAUTY AND BRAIN</h3>

<p class='c013'>It has been stated already that, anatomically considered, the
forehead is not a part of the face but of the cranium. From an
artistic and popular point of view, however, the forehead is a part
of the face, and a most important one. Modern taste fully
endorses the ancient law of facial proportion, which makes the
height of the forehead equal to the length of the nose, and to the
distance from the tip of the nose to the tip of the chin. “Foreheads
villainous low” are objectionable, because associated with a
vulgar unintellectual type of man, and too vividly suggestive of
our simian ancestors. Foreheads abnormally high, though preferable
to the other extreme, displease, because they violate the
law of facial proportion. We excuse them in men, because they
are commonly expressive of intellectual power. But in women a
high forehead is always objectionable, because it gives them a
masculine appearance. Hence Romantic Love, which cannot exist
without sexual contrasts, and which aims at making woman a
perfect embodiment of the laws of Beauty, eliminates girls with
too high foreheads. Yet at the command of Fashion thousands of
maidens deliberately prevent men from falling in love with them
by combing back their hair and giving their foreheads a masculine
appearance, instead of coyly hiding it under a fringe or “bang.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The fact that the feminine forehead, though more perpendicular
than the masculine at the lower part, slants backward in its upper
part in a more pronounced angle, is another reason why women
should cover up this part of their forehead, which Sexual Selection
has not yet succeeded in moulding into perfect shape. For the
receding forehead is universally recognised as a sign of inferior
culture. Everybody knows what is meant by Camper’s facial
angle, which is formed by a horizontal line drawn from the opening
of the ear to the nasal spine, and a perpendicular line touching the
most prominent parts of the forehead and front teeth. In adult
Europeans Camper’s angle rarely exceeds 85 degrees. The average
in the Caucasian race is 80°; in the yellow races 75°; in the
negro 60° to 70°; in the gorilla 31°. In antique Greek heads the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>angle is sometimes over 90°. Says Camper: “If I cause the
facial line to fall in front, I have an antique head; if I incline it
backwards, I have the head of a negro; if I cause it to incline still
further, I have the head of a monkey; inclined still more, I have
that of a dog, and, lastly, that of a goose.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It appears, however, that this angle has more value as a test of
beauty than as an absolute gauge of intellect. Generally speaking,
there is no doubt a correlation between a bulging forehead and a
superior intellect; but individual exceptions to this rule are not
infrequent. Nor is it at all difficult to account for them. For
intellectual power does not depend so much on the size and shape
of the skull as on the convoluted structure of the brain.</p>

<p class='c001'>Our brain consists of two kinds of matter—the white, which is
inside, and the gray, which covers it. The white substance is a
complicated telegraphic network for conveying messages which are
sent from the external gray cells. It has been proved, by comparing
the brains of man and various animals, that the amount of
intelligence depends not so much on the absolute size of the brain,
as on the abundance of this gray matter. And, what is of extreme
importance from a cosmetic point of view, the gray cells are
increased in number, not by an addition to the absolute size or
circumference of the brain, but by a system of furrows and convolutions
which increase the surface lining of the brain without enlarging
its visible mass. For the benefit of those who have never seen
a human brain, it may be very roughly compared to the convoluted
kernel of an English walnut.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wherein lies the æsthetic significance of this mode of cerebral
evolution? It prevents our head from becoming too large. Have
you ever considered why infants appear so ugly to every one but
their mothers? One of the principal reasons is that their heads are
twice as large in proportion to the rest of the body as those of
adults. A child’s stature is equal to four times the height of its
head, an adult’s to eight heads. If our heads continued to grow
larger as our minds expanded, from generation to generation, all
the proportions of human stature would ultimately be violated.
But thanks to the peculiar mode of cerebral evolution just
described, Romantic Love may continue to “select” in accordance
with our present standards of beauty, without thereby favouring
the survival of lower intellectual types.</p>

<p class='c001'>This view of the question also solves a difficulty which has
staggered even such a leading evolutionist as Mr. Wallace, viz.,
the fact that the oldest prehistoric skulls that have been found
“surpass the average of modern European skulls in capacity.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>But if it is the easiest thing in the world to find an ordinary stupid
man in our streets with a larger skull than that of many a clever
brain-worker, why should we attach so much importance to those
prehistoric skulls? Had their brains been examined, they would
doubtless have been found as scantily furrowed as those of a big-headed
modern anarchist.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>FASHIONABLE DEFORMITY</h3>

<p class='c013'>That the intellectual powers are to a large extent independent
of the particular conformation of the skull is shown further by the
circumstance that so many savage tribes have for centuries followed
the fashion of artificially shaping their heads, without any apparent
effect on their minds. Man’s brain incites him, as Topinard
remarks, “to the noblest deeds, as well as to the most ridiculous
practices, such as cutting off the little finger, scorching the soles of
the feet, extracting the front teeth, or deforming the head <em>because
others have done so before him</em>.” But of all silly Fashions hostile
to Beauty, that of deforming the head has found the largest number
of followers—always excepting, of course, the modern Wasp-Waist
Mania.</p>

<p class='c001'>Deformed skulls have been found in the Caucasus, the Crimea,
Hungary, Silesia, France, Belgium, Switzerland, in Polynesia, in
different parts of Asia, etc. “But the classic country in which
these deformations are found is America,” says Topinard. “M.
Gosse has described sixteen species of artificial deformation, ten of
which were in American skulls.” “Sometimes the infant was
fastened on a plank or a sort of cradle with leather straps; or they
applied pieces of clay, pressing them down with small boards on
the forehead, the vertex, and the occiput.... Sometimes the
head was kneaded with the hands or knees, or, the infant being
laid on the back, the elbow was pressed on the forehead. Circular
bands were sometimes employed to support the sides of the
head.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Many American Indians,” says Darwin, “are known to admire
a head so extremely flattened as to appear to us idiotic. The
natives of the north-western coast compress the head into a pointed
cone;” while the inhabitants of Arakhan “admire a broad, smooth
forehead, and in order to produce it, they fasten a plate of lead on
the head of the new-born children.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The genuine Turkish skull is of the broad Tartar form,” says
Mr. Tylor, “while the nations of Greece and Asia Minor have
oval skulls, which gives the reason why at Constantinople it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>became the fashion to mould the babies’ skulls round, so that they
grew up with the broad head of the conquering race. Relics of
such barbarism linger on in the midst of civilisation, and not long
ago a French physician surprised the world by the fact that nurses
in Normandy were still giving the children’s heads a sugar-loaf
shape by bandages and a tight cap, while in Brittany they preferred
to press it round. No doubt they are doing so to this
day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Failure properly to mould the cranium of her offspring,” says
Bancroft, “gives to the Chinook matron the reputation of a lazy
and undutiful mother, and subjects the neglected children to the
ridicule of their young companions, <em>so despotic is fashion</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Food for thought will also be found in these remarks by Darwin.
Ethnologists believe, he says, “that the skull is modified by the
kind of cradle in which infants sleep;” and Schaffhausen is convinced
that “in certain trades, such as that of a shoemaker, where
the head is habitually held forward, the forehead becomes more
round and prominent.” If this is true, then we have one reason,
at least, why authors have such large foreheads.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>WRINKLES</h3>

<p class='c013'>Wrinkles in the face are signs of advanced age, or disease, or
habits of profound meditation, or frequent indulgence in frowning
and grief. The wrinkles on a thinker’s forehead do not arouse our
disapproval, because they are often eloquent of genius, which
excuses a slight sacrifice of the smoothness of skin that belongs to
perfect Beauty. In women, however, we apply a pure and strict
æsthetic standard, wherefore all wrinkles are regarded as regrettable
inroads on Personal Beauty. Old women, of course, form an
exception, because in them we no longer look for youthful Beauty,
and are therefore gratified at the sight of wrinkles and folds as
stereotyped forms of expression bespeaking a life rich in experiences,
and associated with the veneration due to old age. Such wrinkles
are characteristic but not beautiful; and it may be stated, by the
way, that Alison’s whole book on Taste is vitiated by the ever-recurring
argument in which he forgets that we may take a personal
and even an artistic interest in a thing which is characteristic
without being beautiful.</p>

<p class='c001'>In youth, while the skin is firm and elastic, the wrinkles on the
forehead or around the eyes, caused by a frown or smile, pass away,
leaving no more trace than the ripples on the surface of a lake.
With advancing age the skin becomes looser and less elastic, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>that frequent repetition of those movements which produce a fold
in the skin finally leaves an indelible mark on the furrowed countenance.
Woman’s skin, being commonly better “padded” with
fat than man’s, is not so liable to wrinkles, provided attention is
paid to the laws of health. Mantegazza suggests that the simplest
antidote for wrinkles would be to distend the folded skin again by
fattening up. The daily use of <em>good</em> soap and slight friction helps
to ward off wrinkles by keeping the facial muscles toned up and the
skin elastic.</p>

<p class='c001'>The (voluntary) mobility of the skin of the forehead, to which
we owe our wrinkles, affords an interesting illustration of the way
in which facial muscles, once “useful,” have been modified for
mere purposes of expression. “Many monkeys have, and frequently
use, the power of largely moving their scalps up and down.” This
may be of use in shaking off leaves, flies, rain, etc. But man, with
his covered head, needs no such protection; hence most of us have
lost the power of moving our scalps. A correspondent wrote to
Darwin, however, of a youth who could pitch several heavy books
from his head by the movement of the scalp alone; and many
other similar cases are on record, attesting our simian relationship.
But lower down on the forehead, our skin has universally retained
the power of movement, as shown in frowning and the expression
of various emotions.</p>

<p class='c001'>At first sight it is somewhat difficult to understand why meditation
should wrinkle the skin; but Darwin explains it by concluding
that frowning (which, oft repeated, results in wrinkles)
“is not the expression of simple reflection, however profound, or
of attention, however close, but of something difficult or displeasing
encountered in a train of thought or in action. Deep reflection
can, however, seldom be long carried on without some difficulty,
so that it will generally be accompanied by a frown.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Fashionable women sometimes endeavour (unsuccessfully) to
distend the skin and remove wrinkles by pasting court-plaster on
certain spots in the face. But the repulsive fashion of wearing
patches of court-plaster all over the face as an ornament (“beauty-spots!”),
doubtless had its origin in the desire of some aristocratic
dame to conceal pimples or other skin blemishes. At one time
women even submitted to the fashion of pasting on the face and
bosom paper flies, fleas, and other loathsome creatures.</p>

<p class='c001'>The African monkeys who held an indignation meeting when
they first heard of Darwin’s theory of the descent of man, had probably
just been reading a history of human Fashions.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE COMPLEXION</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>WHITE <i>VERSUS</i> BLACK</h3>

<p class='c013'>“The charm of colour, especially in the intricate infinities of
human flesh, is so mysterious and fascinating, that some almost
measure a painter’s merit by his success in dealing with it,” says
Hegel; and again: “Man is the only animal that has flesh in its
display of the infinities of colour.” “No loveliness of colour, even
of the humming birds or the birds of Paradise, is living, is glowing
with its own life, but shines with the lustre of light reflected, and
its charm is from without and not from within” (<cite>Æsthetics</cite>,
Kedney’s edition).</p>

<p class='c001'>For a metaphysician, trained to scornfully ignore facts, the
difference between man and animals is in these sentences pointed
out with commendable insight. Regard for scientific accuracy, it
is true, compels us to qualify Hegel’s generalisation, for not only
have monkeys bare coloured patches in their faces, and elsewhere,
which are subject to changes, but the plumage of birds, too, is
dulled by ill-health and brightened by health, reaching its greatest
brilliancy in the season of Courtship, thus showing a connection
between internal states and external appearances. Nevertheless,
these correspondences in animals are transient and crude; and man
is the only being whose nude skin is sufficiently delicate and transparent
to indicate the minute changes in the blood’s circulation
brought about by various phases of pleasure and pain.</p>

<p class='c001'>To understand the exact nature of these tints of the complexion,
which are so greatly admired—though different nations, as usual,
have different standards of “taste”—it is necessary to bear in
mind a few simple facts of microscopic anatomy.</p>

<p class='c001'>To put the matter graphically, it may be said that our body
wears two tight-fitting physiological coats, called the epidermis or
overskin, and the cutis or underskin.</p>

<p class='c001'>The overskin is not simple, but consists of an outside layer of
horny cells, such as are removed by the razor on shaving, and an
inside mucous layer, as seen on the lips, which have no horny
covering.</p>

<p class='c001'>The underskin contains nerves, fat cells, hairbulbs, and numerous
blood-vessels, some as fine as a hair, all embedded in a soft,
elastic network of connective tissue.</p>

<p class='c001'>The overskin has none of these blood-vessels; but as it is very
delicate and transparent, it allows the colour of the blood to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>seen as through a veil. In the extremely blond races of the North
nothing but the blood can be seen through this veil; but in the
coloured races the lower or mucous layer of the overskin contains
a number of black, brown, or yellowish pigment cells. The colours
of these cells blend with that of the blood, thus producing, according
to their number and depth of coloration, the brunette, black,
yellow, or red complexion. The palm of the negro’s hand is
whiter than the rest of his body, because there the horny epidermis
is so thick that the black pigmentary matter cannot be seen
through it. And the reason why every negro is born to blush unseen
is because the pigmentary matter in his skin is so deep and
abundant that it neutralises the colour of the blood.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, why do the races of various countries differ so greatly in
the colour of their skin? This is the most vexed and difficult
question in anthropology, on which there are almost as many
opinions as writers.</p>

<p class='c001'>The oldest and most obvious theory is that the sun is responsible
for dark complexions. Are not those parts of our body
which are constantly exposed to sunlight—the hands, face, and
neck—darker than the rest of the body? and does not this colour
become darker still if we spend a few weeks in the country or
make a trip across the Atlantic? Do we not find in Europe, as
we pass from the sunny South to the cloudy North, that complexion,
hair, and eyes grow gradually lighter? And not only are
the Spaniards and Italians darker than the Germans, but the South
Germans are darker than the North Germans, and the Swedes and
Norwegians lighter still than the Prussians.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same holds true not only of South America as compared to
North America, but of the southern United States compared to
the northern. It also holds true of the East, where, as Waitz
tells us, “The Chinese from Peking to Canton show every shade
from a light to a dark-copper colour, while in the Arabians, from
the desert down to Yemen, we find every gradation from olive
colour to black.” Moreover, aristocratic ladies in Japan and China
are almost or quite white, whereas the labouring classes, as with
us, are of a darker tint.</p>

<p class='c001'>These and numerous similar facts, taken in connection with the
circumstance that the blackest of all races lives in the hottest continent,
and that Jews may be found of all colours according to the
country they inhabit, lead almost irresistibly to the conclusion that
it is the sun who paints the complexion dark.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless there are numerous and striking exceptions to the
rule that the warmer the climate the darker the complexion. To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>obviate this difficulty, Heusinger in 1829, Jarrold in 1838, and
others after them, have endeavoured to show that the moisture and
altitude, as well as the direct action of the sun, had to be taken
into consideration. But since “D’Orbigny in South America, and
Livingstone in Africa, arrived at diametrically opposite conclusions
with respect to dampness and dryness,” Darwin excogitated the
theory (which, he subsequently found, had already been advanced
in 1813 by Dr. Wells), that inasmuch as “the colour of the skin
and hair is sometimes correlated in a surprising manner with a
complete immunity from the action of certain vegetable poisons,
and from the attacks of parasites ... negroes and other dark
races might have acquired their dark tints by the darker individuals
escaping from the deadly influence of the miasma of their native
countries, during a long series of generations.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The testimony on this point being, however, conflicting and unsatisfactory,
Darwin gave up this notion too, and fell back on the
theory that differences in complexion are due to differences in taste,
and were created through the agency of Sexual Selection. “We
know,” he says, “from the many facts already given that the
colour of the skin is regarded by the men of all races as a highly
important element in their beauty; so that it is a character which
would be likely to have been modified through selection, as has
occurred in innumerable instances with the lower animals. It
seems at first sight a monstrous supposition that the jet-blackness
of the negro should have been gained through sexual selection;
but this view is supported by various analogies, and we know that
negroes admire their own colour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Doubtless there is some truth in Darwin’s view, but it does not
cover the whole ground. Natural as well as Sexual Selection has
been instrumental in producing the diverse colours of various races.
Hitherto the trouble has been that no one could understand how a
black skin could be useful to an African negro. It ought to make
him feel uncomfortably hot—for is it not well known that black
absorbs heat more than any other colour? and do we not feel
warmer in summer if we wear black than if we wear white
clothes?</p>

<p class='c001'>No doubt whatever. But it so happens that the skin is not
made of dead wool or felt. It contains, among various other
ingenious arrangements, a vast number of minute holes or pores,
through which, when we are very warm, the perspiration leaks,
and, in changing into vapour, absorbs the body’s heat and leaves it
cool, or even cold. Now, in a negro’s skin these pores are both
larger and more numerous than in ours, which partly accounts for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>his indifference to heat, and the fact that his temperature is lower
than ours. Yet it does not solve the problem in hand; for there
is no visible reason why Natural Selection should not succeed in
enlarging the number and size of the pores in a white skin as easily
as in a black one.</p>

<p class='c001'>A year or two ago Surgeon-Major Alcock sent a communication
to <cite>Nature</cite> in which, as I believe, he for the first time suggested
the true reason why tropical man is black, and why his blackness
is useful to him. He pointed out that since the pigment-cells in
the negro’s skin are placed in front of the nerve terminations, they
serve to lessen the intensity of the nerve vibrations that would be
caused in a naked human body by exposure to a tropical sun; so
that the pigment plays the same part as a piece of smoked glass
held between the sun and the eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>This ingenious theory at once explains some curious and apparently
anomalous observations communicated to <cite>Nature</cite> by Mr.
Ralph Abercrombie from Darjeeling. They are that “In Morocco,
and all along the north of Africa, the inhabitants blacken themselves
round the eyes to avert ophthalmia from the glare off hot
sand;” that “In Fiji the natives, who are in the habit of painting
their faces with red and white stripes as an ornament, invariably
blacken them when they go out fishing on the reef in the full glare
of the sun;” and that “In the Sikkim hills the natives blacken
themselves round the eyes with charcoal to palliate the glare of a
tropical sun on newly-fallen snow.”</p>

<p class='c001'>How, on the other hand, are we to account for the white complexion
of northern races? It is well known that there is a
tendency among arctic animals to become white. This, in many
cases, can be accounted for by the advantage white beasts of prey,
as well as their victims, thus gain in escaping detection. But it is
probable that another agency comes into play, first suggested by
Craven in 1846, and thus summarised by a writer in <cite>Nature</cite>, 2d
April 1885: “It is well known that white, as the worst absorber,
is also the worst radiator of all forms of radiant energy, so that
<em>warm-blooded</em> creatures thus clad would be better enabled to withstand
the severity of an arctic climate—the loss of heat by radiation
might, in fact, be expected to be less rapid than if the hairs or
feathers were of a darker colour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This argument, which may be applied to man as well as to
animals, is greatly strengthened by a circumstance which at first
appears to oppose it—the fact, namely, that insects in northern
regions, instead of being light-coloured, show a tendency toward
blackness. But this apparent anomaly is easily explained. Insects,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>being cold-blooded, cannot lose any bodily heat through radiation;
whereas a black surface, by absorbing as much solar heat as possible
while it lasts, adds to their comfort and vitality.</p>

<p class='c001'>The question now arises, Which was the original colour of the
human race, white or black? This question, too, we are enabled
to answer with the aid of a principle of evolution which, so far, has
stood every test,—the principle that the child’s development is an
epitome of the evolution of his race. Before birth there is no
colouring matter at all in the skin of a negro child. “In a new-born
child the colour is light gray, and in the northern parts of
the negro countries the completely dark colour is not attained till
towards the third year,” says Waitz; and again, in speaking of
Tahiti: “The children are here (as everywhere in Polynesia) white
at birth, and only gradually assume their darker colour under the
influence of sunlight; covered portions of their bodies remain
lighter, and since women wear more clothes than men, and dwell
more in the shade, they too are often of so light a colour that they
have red cheeks and blush visibly.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So we are entitled to infer that primitive man was originally
white, or whitish. As he moved south, Natural Selection made
him darker and darker by continually favouring the survival of
those individuals whose colour—owing to the spontaneous variation
found throughout Nature—was of a dark shade, and therefore
better able to dull the ardour of the sun’s rays. In the north, on
the contrary, a light complexion was favoured for its quality of
retaining the body’s heat. The yellow and red varieties need not
be specially considered, for it has been shown that the different
tints of the iris are merely due to the greater or less quantity of
the same pigmentary matter; and as the colouring matter of the
complexion and the hair is similar to that of the eye, it is probable
that the same holds true of different hues of the skin; so that
yellowish, brown, and reddish tints may be looked upon as mere
intermediate stages between white and black. A trace of pigment,
indeed, is found even in our skins; and I believe that the reason
why we become brown on exposure to the sun is that the skin,
when thus exposed and irritated, secretes a larger amount of this
colouring matter, to serve, like a dimly-smoked glass, as a protection
against scorching rays.</p>

<p class='c001'>From all these considerations we may safely infer that the particular
hue of man’s skin in each climate is useful to him, and not
merely an ornamental product of “taste,” as Darwin believed.
Yet to some extent Sexual Selection, doubtless, does come into play
in most cases. At a low stage of culture each race likes its special
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>characteristics in an exaggerated form,—a trait which would lead
the more vigorous men to persistently select the darkest girls as
wives, and thus cause their gradual predominance over the others:
while the men, too, would, of course, inherit a darker tint from
their mothers. But a still more important consideration is this,
that, as Dr. Topinard points out, “Dark colour in the negro is <em>a
sign of health</em>,”—naturally, since the darker the dermal pigment,
the better are the nerves of temperature protected against the enervating
solar rays. Concerning the Polynesians, too, Ellis (cited
by Waitz) “notes expressly that a dark colour was more admired
and desired because it was looked upon as a sign of vigour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>These facts yield us a most profound insight into the methods
of amorous selection. The erotic instinct, whose duty is the preservation
of the species, is above all things attracted by Health,
because without Health the species must languish and die out. In
a climate where—under the circumstances in which negroes live—a
light complexion is incompatible with Health, it is bound to be
eliminated.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fortunately, the negro’s taste is not sufficiently refined to make
him feel the æsthetic inferiority of the ebony complexion imposed
on him by his climate. Wherein this æsthetic inferiority consists
is graphically pointed out in these words of Figuier: “The colour
of the skin takes away all charm from the negro’s countenance.
What renders the European’s face pleasing is that each of its
features exhibits a particular shade. The cheeks, forehead, nose,
and chin of the white have each a different tinge. On an African
visage, on the contrary, all is black, even the eyebrows, as inky as
the rest, are merged in the general colour; scarcely another shade
is perceptible, except at the line where the lips join each other.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor is this all. Not only do we look in vain, in the monotonous
blackness of the negro’s face, for those varied tints which
adorn a white maiden’s face, borrowing one another’s charms by
insensible gradations, but also for those subtle emotional changes
which, even if they existed in the negro’s mind, could not paint
themselves so delicately on his opaque countenance, betraying every
acceleration or retardation in the heart’s beats, indicating every
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>nuance</i></span> of hope and despair, of pleasure or anguish.</p>

<p class='c001'>In our own latitude, luckily, Natural Selection favours, in the
manner indicated, the survival of the translucent white complexion.
And what Natural Selection leaves undone, Sexual Selection completes.
Romantic Love is the great awakener of the sense of
Beauty, and in proportion as Love is developed and unimpeded in
its action, does the complexion become more beautiful and more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>appreciated. Savages, blind to the delicate tints of a transparent
skin, daub themselves all over with mixtures of grease and paint.
The women of ancient Greece had taste enough to feel the ugliness
of the pallor caused by being constantly chaperoned and locked up,
but not enough to know that no artificial paint can ever replace
the natural colour of health. Hence, as Becker tells us, “painting
was almost universal among Grecian women.” Perhaps they did
not use any rouge at home, but it “was resumed when they were
going out, or wished to be specially attractive.” The men, apparently,
had better taste, for we read that “Ischomachos counselled
his young wife to take exercise, that she might do without rouge,
which she was accustomed constantly to use.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Coming to more recent times, we find men still protesting in
vain against the feminine fashion of bedaubing the face with vulgar
paint. More than two centuries ago La Bruyère informed his
countrywomen pointedly that “If it is the men they desire to please,
if it is for them that they paint and stain themselves, I have collected
their opinions, and I assure them, in the name of all or most
men, that the white and red paint renders them frightful and
disgusting; that the red alone makes them appear old and artificial;
that men hate as much to see them with cherry in their faces,
as with false teeth in their mouth and lumps of wax in the jaws.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is needless to say that women who paint their faces put
themselves on a level with savages; for they show thereby that
they prefer hideous opaque daubs to the charm of translucent facial
tints. Masculine protestation, combined with masculine amorous
preference for pure complexions, has at last succeeded in banishing
paint from the boudoir of the most refined ladies; and this, combined
with compulsory vaccination against smallpox, accounts for
the increasing number of good complexions in the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, the important question now confronts us, Is there no limit
to the evolution of whiteness of complexion? Will Sexual Selection
continue to favour the lighter shades until the hyperbolic
“milk and blood” complexion will have been universally realised?</p>

<p class='c001'>An emphatic <a id='corr459.34'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='No”'>“No”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_459.34'><ins class='correction' title='No”'>“No”</ins></a></span> is the answer. An exaggerated white is as
objectionable as black,—more so, in fact, because, whereas the
deepest black indicates good health, <em>extreme</em> whiteness suggests
the pallor of ill-health, and will therefore always displease Cupid,
the supreme judge of Personal Beauty. Moreover, in a very white
face the red cheek suggests the confusing blush or the hectic flush
rather than the subtle tints of health and normal emotion. And
again, the Scandinavian rose-and-lily complexion is inferior to the
delicate and slightly-veiled tint of the Spanish brunette, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>the latter suggests <em>the mellowing action of the sun’s rays, which
promises more permanence of beauty</em>. Hence it is that in the
marriage market a decided preference is shown for the brunette
type, as we shall see in the chapter on Blondes and Brunettes.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>COSMETIC HINTS</h3>

<p class='c013'>We are now in a position to understand the extreme importance
of the complexion from an amorous point of view, and to see why
the care of the complexion has almost monopolised the attention
of those desiring to improve their personal appearance, as shown by
the fact that the word “cosmetic,” in common parlance, refers to
the care of the skin alone.</p>

<p class='c001'>Books containing recipes for skin lotions, ointments, and
powders are so numerous, that it is not worth while to devote
much space to the matter here. As a rule, the best advice to
those about to use cosmetics is <em>Don’t</em>. Every man whose admiration
is worth having will infinitely prefer a freckled, or even a
pallid or smallpox-marked, face to one showing traces of powder or
greasy ointments, or lifeless, cadaverous enamel, opaque as ebony
blackness.</p>

<p class='c001'>If a woman’s skin is so morbidly sensitive as to be injured by
ordinary water and good soap, it is a sign of ill-health which calls
for residence in the country and the mellowing rays of the sun.
Where this is unattainable, the water may be medicated by the
addition of a slice of lemon, cucumber, or horse-radish, to all of
which magic effects are often attributed. The black spots on the
sides of the nose may be removed in a few weeks by the daily
application (with friction) of lemon juice. For pimples and barber’s
itch a camphor and sulphur ointment, which may be obtained of
any chemist, is the simplest remedy. For a shiny, polished complexion,
and excessive redness of the nose, cheeks, and knuckles,
the following mixture is recommended by a good authority:—Powdered
borax, one half ounce; <em>pure</em> glycerine, one ounce;
camphor-water, one quart. Borax, indeed, is as indispensable a
toilet article as soap or a nail-brush. After washing the face, exposure
to the raw air should always be avoided for ten or fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A certain amount of friction applied to the face daily will do
much,” says Dr. Bulkley, “to keep the pores of the sebaceous
glands open; and, by stimulating the face, to prevent the formation
of the black specks and red spots so common in young people,
I generally direct that the face be rubbed to a degree short of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>discomfort, and that the towel be not too rough.” Slight friction
also helps to ward off wrinkles.</p>

<p class='c001'>Two or three weekly baths—hot in winter, cold in summer—are
absolutely necessary for those who wish to keep their skin in a
healthy condition; and no elixir of youth and beauty could produce
such a sparkling eye and glow of rosy health as a daily
morning sponge bath, followed by friction—care being taken, in a
cold room, to expose only one part of the body at a time. The
importance of keeping open the pores of the skin by bathing is
seen by the fact that if a man were painted with varnish he would
suffocate in a few hours; for the skin is a sort of external lung,
aiding its internal colleague in removing effete products, dissolved
in the perspiration, from the system.</p>

<p class='c001'>The debris and oily matter brought to the surface of the skin
and deposited there by the perspiration cannot be completely
removed without soap. Unfortunately, this article has done more
to ruin complexions than almost any other cause, except smallpox
and the superstitious dread of sunshine. Many people have a
peculiar mania for economising in soap. If they can buy a piece
of soap for a farthing, they consider themselves wonderfully clever,
regardless of the fact that it may not only ruin their complexion,
but produce a repulsive skin disease which it will cost much gold
to cure. Do they ever realise that these soaps, which they thus
smear over the most delicate parts of their body every day, are made
of putrid carcasses of animals, rancid fat, and corrosive alkalies?
Has no one ever told them that if a soap is both cheap and highly
perfumed it is <em>certain</em> to be of vile composition, and injurious to
the skin? After washing yourself wait a moment till the soap’s
artificial odour has disappeared, and then smell your hands. That
vile rancid odour which remains—if you knew its source, you would
immediately run for a Turkish bath to wash off the very epidermis
to which that odour has adhered.</p>

<p class='c001'>What has ruined so many complexions is not soap itself, but
bad soap. A famous specialist, Dr. Bulkley, says that “there is
no intrinsic reason why soap should not be applied to the face,
although there is a very common impression among the profession,
as well as the laity, that it should not be used there.... The
fact is, that many cases of eruptions upon the face are largely due
to the fact that soap has <em>not</em> been used on that part; and it is
also true that, if properly employed, and <em>if the soap is good</em>, it is
not only harmless, but beneficial to the skin of the face, as to every
other part of the body.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A word may be added in reference to the so-called ‘medicated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>soaps,’ whose number and variety are legion, each claiming virtues
far excelling all others previously produced.... Now all or most
of this attempt to ‘medicate’ soap is a perfect farce, a delusion,
and a snare to entrap the unwary and uneducated.... Carbolic
soap is useless and may be dangerous, because the carbolic acid
may possibly become the blind beneath which a cheap, poor soap
is used; for in all these advertised and patented nostrums the
temptation is great to employ inferior articles that the pecuniary
gain may be greater. The small amount of carbolic acid incorporated
in the soap cannot act as an efficient disinfectant.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>FRECKLES AND SUNSHINE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Soap is not the only cosmetic that has been tabooed in the face
because of illogical reasoning. There is a much more potent
beautifying influence—viz., the mellowing rays of the sun—of
which the face has long been deprived, chiefly on account of an
unscientific prejudice that the sun is responsible for freckles. In
his famous work on skin diseases Professor Hebra of Vienna, the
greatest modern authority in his specialty, has completely disproved
this almost universally accepted theory. The matter is of
such extreme importance to Health and Beauty that his remarks
must be quoted at length:—</p>

<p class='c001'>"It is a fact that lentigo (freckles) neither appears in the
newly-born nor in children under the age of 6-8 years, whether
they run about the whole day in the open air and exposed to the
bronzing influence of the sun, or whether they remain confined to
the darkest room; it is therefore certain that neither light nor air
nor warmth produces such spots in children....</p>

<p class='c001'>“If we examine the skin of an individual who is said to be
affected with the so-called freckles only in the summer, at other
seasons of the year with sufficient closeness in a good light, and
with the skin put on the stretch by the finger, we shall detect the
same spots, of the same size but of somewhat lighter colour than
in summer. In further illustration of what has just been said, I
will mention that I have repeatedly had the opportunity of seeing
lentigines on parts of the body that, as a rule, are never exposed
to the influence of the light and sun....</p>

<p class='c001'>”<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>A priori</i></span>, it is difficult to understand how ephelides can
originate from the influence of sun and light in the singular form
of disseminated spots, since these influences act not only on single
points, but uniformly over the whole surface of the skin of the face,
hands, etc. The pigmentary changes must appear, therefore, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>the form of patches, not of points. Moreover, it is known to every
one that, if the skin of the face be directly exposed, even for only
a short time, to a rough wind or to intense heat, a tolerably dark
bronzing appears, which invades the affected parts uniformly, and
not in the form or disseminated, so-called summer-spots (freckles).
It was, therefore, only faulty observation on the part of our forefathers
which induced them to attribute the ephelides to the
influence of light and sun."</p>

<p class='c001'>But the amount of mischief done by this “faulty observation of
our forefathers” is incalculable. To it we owe the universal feminine
horror of sunshine, without which it is as impossible for their
complexion to have a healthy, love-inspiring aspect, as it is for a
plant grown in a cellar to have a healthy green colour. How
many women are there who preserve their youthful beauty after
twenty-five—the age when they ought to be in full bloom? They
owe this early decay partly to their indolence, mental and physical,
partly to their habit of shutting out every ray of sunlight from
their faces as if it were a rank poison instead of the source of all
Health and Beauty. If young ladies would daily exercise their
muscles in fresh air and sunshine, they would not need veils to
make themselves look younger. Veils may be useful against very
rough wind, but otherwise they should be avoided, because they
injure the eyesight. Parasols are a necessity on very hot summer
afternoons, but “the rest of the year the complexion needs all the
sun it can get.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Were any further argument needed to convince us that the sun
has been falsely accused of creating freckles, it would be found in
the fact that southern brunette races, though constantly exposed
to the sun, are much less liable to them than the yellow and
especially the red-haired individuals of the North. Professor
Hebra regards freckles as “a freak of Nature rather than as a
veritable disease,” and thinks they are “analogous to the piebald
appearances met with in the lower animals.” As has just been
noted, they exist in winter as well as in summer. All that the
summer heat does is to make them visible by making the skin
more transparent. As the heat itself causes them to appear any
way, it is useless to taboo the direct sunlight as their source.</p>

<p class='c001'>Inasmuch as freckles appear chiefly among northern races,
whose skin has been excessively bleached and weakened in its
action by constant indoor life, it seems probable, notwithstanding
Dr. Hebra’s opinion, that they are the result of an unhealthy,
abnormal action of the pigment-secreting apparatus which exists
even in the white skin. If this be so, then proper care of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>skin continued for several generations would obliterate them.
The reason why country folks are more liable to freckles than
their city cousins would then be referable, not to the greater
amount of sunlight in the country, but to the rarity of bath-tubs,
good soap, and friction-towels. My own observation leads me to
believe that freckles are rarer in England than on the continent,
and the English are proverbially enamoured of the bath-tub and
open-air exercise.</p>

<p class='c001'>For those who, without any fault of their own, have inherited
freckles from their parents, there is this consoling reflection that
these blemishes reside in a very superficial layer of the skin, and
can therefore be removed. Several methods are known; but as
no one should ever use them without medical assistance, they need
not be described here (see Hebra’s <cite>Treatise</cite>, vol. iii.) Any one
who wishes to temporarily conceal skin-blemishes may find this
citation from Hebra of use: “Perfumers and apothecaries have
prepared from time immemorial cosmetics whose chief constituent
is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>talcum venetum</i></span>, or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pulvis aluminis plumosi</i></span> (Federweiss), which,
when rubbed in, in the form of a paste, with water and alcohol,
or a salve with lard, or quite dry, as a powder, gives to the skin
an agreeable white colour, and does not injure it in the least, even
if the use of the cosmetic be continued throughout life.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is probable that electricity will play a grand <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span> in future
as an agent for removing superfluous hairs, freckles, moles, port-wine
marks, etc. Much has already been done in this direction,
and the only danger is in falling into the hands of an unscrupulous
quack. In vol. iii. No. 4 of the <cite>Journal of Cutaneous and
Venereal Diseases</cite>, Dr. Hardaway has an interesting article on
this subject.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE EYES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In one of the Platonic dialogues Sokrates points out the relativity
of standards of Beauty. “Is not,” he asks in effect, “the
most beautiful ape ugly compared to a maiden? and is not the
maiden, in turn, inferior in beauty to a goddess?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Regarding most of the human features it may be conceded that
Sokrates is right in his second question. To find a human forehead,
nose, or mouth that could not be improved in some respect,
is perhaps impossible. But <em>one</em> feature must be excepted. There
are human eyes which no artist with a goddess for a model could
make more divine. And of these glorious orbs there are so many,
in every country, that one cannot help concluding that Schopenhauer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>made a great mistake in placing the face, with the eyes, so
low down in his list of love-inspiring human qualities. On the
contrary, I am convinced that no feminine charm so frequently
and so fatally fascinates men as lovely eyes, and that it is for this
reason that Sexual Selection has done more to perfect the eyes
than any other part of the body.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Petruchio says of Katharina that “she looks as clear as
morning roses newly washed with dew,” he compliments her complexion;
but when the Persian poet compares “a violet sparkling
with dew” to “the blue eyes of a beautiful girl in tears,” the
compliment is to the violet. A woman’s eye is the most beautiful
object in the universe; and what made it so is man’s Romantic
Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>Putting poetry aside, we must now consider a few scientific
facts and correct a few misconceptions regarding the eye, its colour,
lustre, form, and expression.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>COLOUR</h3>

<p class='c013'>To say of any one that he has gray, blue, brown, or black eyes,
is vague and incorrect from a strictly scientific point of view,
inasmuch as there are no really gray or black eyes, and, as a
matter of fact, every eye, if closely examined, shows at least five
or six different colours.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is, first, the tough sclerotic coat or <em>white</em> of the eye,
which covers the greater part of the eyeball, and is not transparent,
except in front where the coloured <em>iris</em> (or rainbow membrane)
is seen through it. This central transparent portion of the
sclerotic coat is called the cornea, and is slightly raised above the
general surface of the eyeball, like the middle portion of some
watch-glasses.</p>

<p class='c001'>The white of the eye is sometimes slightly tinged with blue
or yellow, and sometimes netted with inflamed blood-vessels. All
these deviations are æsthetically inferior to the pure white of the
healthy European, because suggestive of disease, and conflicting
with the general cosmic standards of beauty. The bluish tint is a
sign of consumption or scrofulous disorders, being caused by a
diminution of the pigmentary matter in the choroid coat which
lines the inside of the sclerotic. The yellowish tint, in the
European, is indicative of jaundice, dyspepsia, or premature degeneracy
of the white of the eye. It is normal, on the other
hand, in the healthy negro; but if a negro should claim that,
inasmuch as a yellowish sclerotic is to him not suggestive of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>disease, he has as much right to consider it beautiful as we our
white sclerotic, the simple retort would be, that we are guided in our
æsthetic judgment by positive as well as negative tests. Disease
is the negative test; the positive lies in the fact that in inanimate
objects, where disease is altogether out of the question—as in
ivory ornaments (which no one associates with an elephant’s tusk)—we
also invariably prefer a pure snowy white to a muddy uncertain
yellow. It is these two tests in combination which have
guided Sexual Selection in its efforts to eliminate all but the pure
white sclerotic,—a tint which, moreover, throws into brighter
relief the enchanting hues of the “sunbeamed” iris.</p>

<p class='c001'>More objectionable still than a yellowish or bluish sclerotic is a
bloodshot eye, not only because the inflamed blood-vessels which
swell and flood the white surface of the eye deface the marble
purity of the sclerotic (in a manner not in the least analogous to
marble “veins”), but because the red, watery blear eye generally
indicates the ravages of intemperance or unrestrained passions.
However, a bloodshot eye may be the result of mere overwork, or
reading in a flickering light, or lack of sleep; hence it is not
always safe to allow the disagreeable æsthetic impression given by
inflamed eyes to prognosticate moral obliquity. But, after all,
the intimate connection between æsthetic and moral judgments is
in this case based on a correct, subtle instinct; for is not a man
who ruins the health and beauty of his eyes by intemperance in
drink or night-work sinning against himself? If attempts at
suicide are punished by law, why should not minor offences against
one’s Health at least be looked upon with moral disapproval? If
this sentiment could be made universal, there would be fifty per
cent more Beauty in the world after a single generation.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the centre of the white sclerotic is the membrane which
gives the eyes their characteristic variations of colour,—the iris or
rainbow curtain. If we look at an eye from a distance of a few
paces, it seems to have some one definite colour, as brown or blue.
But on closer examination we see that there are always several
hues in each iris. The colour of the iris is due to the presence of
small pigment granules in its interior layer. These granules are
<em>always</em> brown, in blue and gray as well as in brown eyes; and
the greater their number and thickness, the darker is the colour
of the iris. Blue eyes are caused by the presence, in front of the
pigment-layer, of a thin, almost colourless membrane, which
absorbs all the rays of light except the blue, which it reflects, and
thus causes the translucent iris to appear of that colour.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Instructions de la Société d’Anthropologie</span>, says Dr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>Topinard, "recognise four shades of colour,—brown, green, blue,
and gray; each having five tones—the very dark, the dark, the
intermediate, the light, and the very light. The expression
“brown” does not mean pure brown; it is rather a reddish, a
yellowish, or a greenish brown, corresponding with the chestnut or
auburn colour, the hazel and the sandy, made use of by the
English. The gray, too, is not pure; it is, strictly speaking, a
violet more or less mixed with black and white."</p>

<p class='c001'>“The negro, in spite of his name, is not black but deep brown,”
as Mr. Tylor remarks; and what is true of his complexion is also
true of his eyes; “what are popularly called black eyes are far
from having the iris really black like the pupil; eyes described as
black are commonly of the deepest shades of brown or violet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The pupil, however, is always jetblack, not only in negroes, but
in all races. For the pupil is simply a round opening in the
centre of the iris which allows us to see clear through the lens
and watery substance of the eyeball to the black pigment which
lines its inside surface. The iris, in truth, is nothing but a
muscular curtain for regulating the size of the pupil, and thus
determining how much light shall be admitted into the interior of
the eye. When the light is bright and glaring, a little of it
suffices for vision, hence the iris relaxes its fibres and the pupil
becomes smaller; whereas, in twilight and moonlight, the eye
needs all the light it can catch, so the muscles of the iris-curtain
contract and enlarge the pupil-window. This mechanism of the
iris in diminishing or enlarging the pupil can be neatly observed
by looking into a mirror placed on one side of a window. If the
hand is put up in such a way as to screen the eye from the light,
the pupil will be seen to enlarge; and if the hand is then suddenly
taken away, it will immediately return to its smaller size. For
the muscles of the iris have the power, denied to other unstriped
or involuntary muscles, of acting quite rapidly.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus we find in the eyeball three distinct zones of colour—the
white of the eye, sometimes slightly tinted blue, yellow, or red;
the iris, which has various shades of brown, green, blue, and gray,
commonly two or three in each eye; and the central black pupil.
Add to this the flesh-colour of the eyelid and surrounding parts,
and the light or dark lashes and eyebrows, and we see that the
eye in itself is a perfect colour-symphony.</p>

<p class='c001'>Can we account for the existence of all these colours? The
easiest thing in the world, with the aid of the principles of Natural
and Sexual Selection. There are reasons for believing that the
sense of sight is merely a higher development from the sense of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>temperature, adapted to vibrations so rapid that the nerves of
temperature can no longer distinguish them. In its simplest
form, among the lowest animals, the sense of sight is represented
by a mere pigment spot. And in the highest form of sight, after
the development of the various parts of our complicated eye, we
still find this pigment as one of the most essential conditions of
vision. Its function, however, is not the same as that of the pigment
in the human skin. There it is interposed between the sun
and the underskin, in order to protect the nerves of temperature.
The optic nerve needs no such protection; for the heat-rays of the
sun cannot but be cooled on passing through the membranes, the
lens, and the watery substance in the eye, before reaching the
optic nerve, spread out on the retina. Consequently the eye-pigment,
instead of being placed in front of the nerves, is put
behind them; and their function is to absorb any excess of light
that enters the eye. Were the membrane which contains this
pigment whitish, all the light would be reflected back, and create
such a glare and confusion that no object could be seen distinctly.</p>

<p class='c001'>This view regarding the function of the pigment is strikingly
supported by the anomalous case of Albinos. “The pink of their
eyes (as of white rabbits) is caused by the absence of the black
pigment,” says Mr. Tylor, “so that light passing out through the
iris and pupil is tinged red from the blood-vessels at the back;
thus their eyes may be seen to blush with the rest of the face.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bearing these facts in mind, it is obvious why it is an advantage
in a sunny country to have as much pigmentary matter as
possible in the eye, and why, therefore, Natural Selection makes
the eyes blacker the nearer we approach the tropics. And, as
with the complexion, so here, it is fortunate for the negro that he
has not sufficient taste to feel the æsthetic inferiority of the
monotonous black thus imposed on him by Natural Selection.
“The iris is so dark,” says Figuier, “as almost to be confounded
with the black of the pupil. In the European, the colour of the
iris is so strongly marked as to render at once perceptible whether
the person has black, blue, or gray eyes. There is nothing similar
in the case of the negro, where all parts of the eye are blended in
the same hue. Add to this that the white of the eye is always
suffused with yellow in the Negro, and you will understand how
this organ, which contributes so powerfully to give life to the
countenance of the White, is invariably dull and expressionless in
the Black Race.”</p>

<p class='c001'>To the Esquimaux, living in the constant glare of ice and
snowfields, a protective pigment is quite as necessary as to an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>African savage; hence their eyes are equally black. But among
other northern races, who are less constantly exposed to the
blinding rays of the sun, it suffices to have coal-black pigment in
the back part of the eye, as seen through the pupil, while the iris
need not be so absolutely opaque. This leaves room for the
action of Sexual Selection in giving the preference to eyes less
monotonously black. Our æsthetic sense craves variety and contrasts
in colour; and as the sense of Beauty originally stood in
the service of Love almost exclusively, it is to Cupid’s selective
action that we doubtless owe the diverse hues of the modern iris.</p>

<p class='c001'>To what kind of an iris does modern Love or æsthetic selection
give the preference? Doubtless to that which has the deepest
and most unmistakable colour—to dark brown, or deep blue, or
violet. One reason why we care less for the lighter, faded tints of
the iris is because they present a less vivid contrast to the white
of the eye; and another reason, as Dr. Hugo Magnus suggests,
lies in the disagreeable impression produced in us by the difficulty
of making out the exact character of the various indistinct shades
of gray, yellow, green, or blue.</p>

<p class='c001'>The consideration of the question whether amorous selection
shows any further preference for one of its two favourite colours—dark
brown and deep blue—must be deferred to the chapter on
Blondes and Brunettes.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>LUSTRE</h3>

<p class='c013'>But Cupid is not guided by colour alone in his choice. However
beautiful the colour of an eye, it loses half its charm if it
lacks lustre. A bright, sparkling eye is the most infallible index
of youthful vigour and health, whereas the lack-lustre eyes of ill-health
can never serve as windows from which Cupid shoots his
arrows. No wonder that the poets have searched all nature for
analogies to the lustre of a maiden’s eye, comparing it to sun and
stars, to diamonds, crystalline lakes, the light of glow-worms,
glistening dewdrops, etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>What is the source of this light which shines from the eye
and intoxicates the lover’s senses? Several answers to this
question have been suggested. Twenty-five hundred years ago
Empedokles taught that “there is in the eye a fine network
which holds back the watery substance swimming about in it, but
the fiery particles penetrate through it like the rays of light
through a lantern” (Ueberweg). And a notion similar to this,
that there is a kind of magnetic or nervous emanation which
beams from the eye and is a direct efflux of the soul, was entertained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>in recent times by Lavater and Carus. It was apparently
supported by the peculiar light which may be seen occasionally in
the eyes of cats, dogs, and horses in the twilight; but this has
been proved to be a purely physical phenomenon of reflection, due
to an anatomical peculiarity in the eyes of these animals.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some writers have attempted to account for the lustrous fire of
the eye by attributing it to the increased tension of the eyeball
brought about through certain joyous and exciting emotions. Dr.
Hugo Magnus, however, denies that these emotions ever increase
the tension of the eyeball: “We know from numerous exceedingly
minute measurements that there is no such thing whatever as a
rapid change of tension in the eye, as long as it is in a healthy
condition.” In some diseases, especially in cataract or glaucoma,
such an increased tension does occur, indeed, but it does not in
the least impart to the eye the sparkle of joyous excitement.
Hence Professor Magnus concludes that “the mimic significance
of the eye cannot be conditioned by changes in the form of the
eyeball, through tension or pressure on it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>His own theory (as developed in his two interesting pamphlets,
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Die Sprache der Augen</cite></span> and <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Das Auge in seinen aesthetischen und
culturgeschichtlichen Beziehungen</cite></span>) is that the greater or less
brilliancy of the eyes depends entirely on the movements of
the eyelids. Instead of calling the eye the window of the soul,
it is more correct to say that the cornea is a mirror which,
like any other mirror, reflects the light that falls on it. The
higher the eyelids are raised the larger becomes the mirror, and
the more light is therefore reflected. Now it is well known
that exciting emotions like joy, enthusiasm, anger, and pride have
a tendency to raise the eyelids, while the sad and depressing
emotions cause them to sink and partially cover the eyeball;
hence joy makes the eyes sparkling, while grief renders them dull
and lustreless.</p>

<p class='c001'>The old poetic and popular notion that the lustre of the eye is
a direct emanation of the human soul must therefore be abandoned.
The sparkling eye is a mere physical consequence of the involuntary
raising of the eyelids brought about through exhilarating or
exciting emotions.</p>

<p class='c001'>This theory of Dr. Magnus doubtless comes nearer the truth
than the others referred to; and the fact that snakes’ eyes, though
small, are proverbially glistening, apparently because they are
lidless, may be used as an additional argument in his favour,
which he overlooked. Yet his view does not cover the whole
ground; for it does not explain why, after weeping, or when we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>are weary or ill, we may open our eyes as widely as we please
without making them appear lustrous.</p>

<p class='c001'>This difficulty suggested to me the theory that, though
partly dependent on the movements of the eyelids, the lustre
of the eyes is due originally to the tension and moisture of the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>conjunctiva</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>conjunctiva</i></span>, though consisting of 6-8 layers of cells, is an
extremely thin and highly sensitive, transparent membrane, which
lines the surface of the eyeball as well as the inside of the eyelids.
In this membrane is located the pain which we feel if dust,
etc., flies into our eyes. In order to wash out any particles that
may get into the eye, and to prevent the lid from sticking to
the eyeball, the lachrymal glands constantly secrete the water,
which, during an emotional shower, consolidates into tear-drops.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, just as “the rose is sweetest washed with morning
dew,” so the eye is brightest and most fascinating which glistens
in an ever fresh supply of lachrymal fluid. After weeping, this
supply is temporarily exhausted, hence not only are the eyes
“sticky” and the lids difficult to raise, but even if they are
raised there is no lustre; you look in vain for “Cupid’s bonfires
burning in the eye.” But when we wake up from refreshing
sleep in the morning, or when we take a walk in the bracing
country air, the eye sparkles its best and “emulates the diamond,”
because at such a time all the vital energies, including of course
those of the lachrymal glands, are incited to fresh activity, which
they lose again after prolonged use of the eye, thus making it
appear duller in the evening.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus we can readily account for those lights in the eye “that
do mislead the morn.” Yet it is probable that (although in a less
degree than dewy moisture) the tension and translucency of the
conjunctiva are also concerned in the production of a liquid,
lustrous expression. Though the eyeball itself may not undergo
any changes in tension, the conjunctiva doubtless does. The
eyeball rests on a bed of fatty tissue which shrinks after death,
owing to the emptying of the blood-vessels and the consolidation
of the fat, which makes a corpse appear “hollow-eyed.”
The same effect, to a slighter degree, is caused by disease and excessive
fatigue, making the eyes sink into their sockets. This
sinking must diminish the tension of the conjunctiva, both under
the eyelids and on the surface of the eyeball; and in shrinking it
becomes less transparent and glistening.</p>

<p class='c001'>The following observations of Professor Kollmann indirectly
support my theory that the conjunctiva is the source of the eye’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>lustre: “After death this transparent membrane (the conjunctiva)
becomes turbid, the eye loses its lustre and becomes veiled. The
surface reflects but a faint degree of light, the eye is ‘broken.’”
The loss of lustre extends to the white of the eye, but is less
noticeable, perhaps because there lustre does not blend with
colour, as in the iris region.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fashionable young ladies who dance throughout the night
several times a week may well be disgusted with the <em>blue</em> rings
which appear around their sunken eyes. These rings are a
warning that they need “beauty sleep” and fresh air to fill up the
sockets again with healthy fat and <em>red</em> blood, so as to increase the
tension of the conjunctiva and stimulate the flow of dewy moisture
on which the lustre of the eye depends. There are tears of Beauty
as well as of anguish and joy.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>FORM</h3>

<p class='c013'>Of the beauty of the eye as conditioned by its form, Dr.
Magnus has made such an admirable and exhaustive analysis
that I can do little more than summarise his observations. He
points out, in the first place, that the form of the eyeball itself is
of subordinate importance. The differences in the size and shape
of eyeballs are insignificant, and are, moreover, liable to be concealed
by the shape of the eyelids; hence it is to the lids and brows
that the eye chiefly owes its formal beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The form of the eye is conditioned exclusively by the cut of
the lids and the size of the aperture between them.... The
countless individual differences in this aperture give to the eyeballs
the most diverse shapes, so that we speak of round eyes, wide
eyes, almond-shaped, elongated, and owl eyes, etc.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The first condition of beauty in an eye is size. Large eyes
have been extolled ever since the beginnings of poetry. The
Mahometan heaven is peopled with “virgins with chaste mien
and large black eyes,” and the Arabian poets never tire of comparing
their idols’ eyes to those of the gazelle and the deer. The
Greeks appear to have considered large eyes an essential trait of
beauty as well as of mental superiority; hence Sokrates as well as
Aspasia are described as having had such eyes; and who has not
read of Homer’s ox-eyed Juno? Juvenal specially mentions small
eyes as a blemish.</p>

<p class='c001'>Large eyes, however, are not beautiful if the aperture between
the lids is too wide, or if the white can be seen above the iris.
They must owe their largeness to the graceful curvature of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>upper eyelid. As Winckelmann remarks, “Jupiter, Apollo, and
Juno have the opening of their eyelids large and vaulted,
and less elongated than is usual, so as to make the arch more
pronounced.”</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time we are sufficiently catholic in taste to admire
eyes which are not quite round but somewhat elongated. One
favourite variety is that in which “the upper lid shows, in the
margin adjoining the inner corner of the eye, a rather decided
curvature, which, however, diminishes toward the outer corner in
an extremely graceful and pleasing wavy line. As the lower lid
has a similar, though less decided, marginal curve, the eyeball
which appears within this aperture assumes a unique oval form,
which has been very aptly and characteristically named ‘almond-shaped.’
The Greeks compared the graceful curve of such lids to
the delicate and pleasing loops formed by young vines, and therefore
called an eye of this variety ἑλικοβλέφαρος. Winckelmann
has noted that it was the eyes of Venus, in particular, that the
ancient artists were fond of adorning with this graceful curve of
the lids.... Italian, and especially Spanish eyes, are far-famed
for their classical and graceful oval form.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Almond eyes are peculiar to the Semitic and ancient Aryan
races. Some of the bards of India sing the praises of an eye
so elongated that it reaches to the ear; and in Assyrian statues
such eyes are common. The ancient Egyptians had a similar
taste; and Carus relates that some Oriental nations actually enlarge
the slit of the eye with the knife; while others use cosmetics
to simulate the appearance of very long eyes. According to Dr.
Sömmering, the eye of male Europeans is somewhat less elongated
than that of females.</p>

<p class='c001'>Round or oval marginal curvature, however, is not the only
condition of beauty in an eyelid. The surface, too, must be
kept in a tense, well-rounded condition. Sunken, hollow eyes
displease us not only because they suggest disease and age, but
because they destroy the smooth surface and curvature of the
eyelids. Thus do we find the laws of Health and Beauty coinciding
in the smallest details.</p>

<p class='c001'>The position of the eye also largely influences our æsthetic
judgment. What strikes us first in looking at a Chinaman is
his obliquely-set eyes, with the outer corner drawn upwards, which
displeases us even more than their excessive elongation and small
size. Oblique eyes are a dissonance in the harmony of our
features, and almost as objectionable as a crooked mouth. True,
our own eyes are rarely absolutely horizontal, but the deviation is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>too minute to be noticed by any but a trained observer. Sometimes,
as Mantegazza remarks, the opposite form may be noticed,
the outer corner of the eye being lower than the inner. “If this
trait is associated with other æsthetic elements, it may produce
a rare and extraordinary charm, as in the case of the Empress
Eugénie.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The eyelashes and eyebrows, though strictly belonging in the
chapter on the hair, must be referred to here because they bear
such a large part in the impression which the form of the eye
makes on us. The short, stiff hairs, which form “the fringed
curtain of the eye,” are attached to the cartilage which edges the
eyelids. They are not straight but curved, downward in the
lower, upward in the upper lid. And the Beauty-Curve is observed
in still another way, the hairs in the central part of
each lid being longer than they are towards the ends. In the
upper lid the hairs are longer than in the lower. Their æsthetic
and physiognomic value will be considered presently under the
head of Expression.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the eyebrows the Curve of Beauty is again the condition
of perfection. It must be a gentle curve, however, or else it
imparts to the countenance a Mephistophelian expression of irony.
Eyebrows were formerly held to be peculiar to man, but Darwin
states that “in the Chimpanzee, and in certain species of
Macacus, there are scattered hairs of considerable length rising
from the naked skin above the eyes, and corresponding to our
eyebrows; similar long hairs project from the hairy covering of
the superciliary ridges in some baboons.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The existence of the eyebrows may be accounted for on utilitarian
grounds. Natural Selection favoured their development
because they are, like the lashes, of use in preventing perspiration
and dust from getting into the eyes. Their delicately curved form,
however, they probably owe to Sexual Selection. Cupid objects
to eyebrows which are too much or not sufficiently arched, and he
objects to those which are too bushy or which meet in the middle.
The ancient Greeks already disliked eyebrows meeting in the
middle, whereas in Rome Fashion not only approved of them,
but even resorted to artificial means for producing them. The
Arabians go a step farther in the use of paint. They endeavour
to produce the impression as if their eyebrows grew down to the
middle of the nose and met there. The Egyptians, Assyrians,
Persians, and Indians also used paint to make their eyebrows
seem wider, but they did not unite them. On the outside border
the eyebrows should extend slightly beyond the corner of the eye.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>EXPRESSION</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In the chapter on the nose reference was made to our disposition
to seize upon any sensation experienced inside the mouth and
label it as a “taste,” whereas psychologic analysis shows that in
most cases the sense of smell (excited during <em>exhalation</em>) has more
to do with our enjoyment of food than taste; and that the nerves
of temperature and touch likewise come into play in the case of
peppermint, pungent condiments, alcohol, etc. We are also in the
habit of including in the term “feeling” or “touch” the entirely
distinct sensations of temperature, tickling, and some other sensations,
to the separate study of which physiologists are only now
beginning to devote special attention.</p>

<p class='c001'>Similarly with the eyes. Being the most fascinating part of
the face, on which we habitually fix our attention while talking,
they are credited with various expressions that are really referable
to other features, which we rapidly scan and then transfer their
language to the eyes. Nor is this all. Most persons habitually
attribute to the varying lustre of the eyeball diverse “soulful”
expressions which, as physiologic analysis shows, are due to the
<em>movements</em> of the eyeball, the eyebrows, and lashes. The poets,
who have said so many beautiful things about the eyes, are rarely
sufficiently definite to lay themselves open to the charge of inaccuracy.
But there can be little doubt that the popular opinion
concerning the all-importance of the eyeball is embodied in such
expressions as these: “Love, anger, pride, and avarice all visibly
move in those little orbs” (Addison). “Her eye in silence has a
speech which eye best understands” (Southwell). “An eye like
Mars to threaten or command.” “The heavenly rhetoric of thine
eye, ’gainst which the world cannot hold argument.” “Behold
the window of my heart, mine eye.” “Sometimes from her eyes
I did receive fair speechless messages.” “For shame, lie not, to
say mine eyes are murderers.” “If mine eyes can wound, now let
them kill thee.” “There’s an eye wounds like a leaden sword.”
The last three of these Shaksperian lines were evidently echoing
in Emerson’s mind when he wrote that “Some eyes threaten like
a loaded and levelled pistol, and others are as insulting as hissing
or kicking; some have no more expression than blueberries, while
others as deep as a well which you can fall into.” “Glances are
the first <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>billets-doux</i></span> of love,” says Ninon de L’Enclos.</p>

<p class='c001'>In order to make perfectly clear the mechanism by which
the eye becomes an organ of speech, it is advisable to consider
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>separately these six factors, which are included in it—(<i>a</i>) Lustre;
(<i>b</i>) Colour of the Iris; (<i>c</i>) Movements of the Iris or Pupil; (<i>d</i>)
Movements of the Eyeball; (<i>e</i>) Movements of the Eyelids; (<i>f</i>)
Movements of the Eyebrows.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>a</i>) <em>Lustre.</em>—"The physiological problem whether the surface
of the eyeball, independent of the muscles that cover and surround
it, can express emotion, a near study of the American girl seems
to answer quite in the affirmative." Dr. G. M. Beard remarks,
without, however, endeavouring to specify what emotions the
surface of the eyeball expresses, or in what manner it does express
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr. Magnus, on the other hand, who has made a more profound
study of this question than any other writer, is emphatic in his
conviction that “the eyeball takes no active part in the expression
of emotions, which is entirely accomplished by the muscles and
soft parts surrounding it.” His view is supported by the fact that
although some of the ancient sculptors endeavoured by the use of
jewels or by chiselling semi-lunar or other grooves into the eyeball
to simulate its lustre by means of shadows, yet as a rule sculptors
and painters strangely neglect the careful elaboration of the eyeball;
and in the Greek works of the best period, including those
of Phidias, the eyeball was left smooth and unadorned, the artists
relying especially on the careful chiselling of the lids and brows
for the attainment of the particular characteristic expression
desired.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless Dr. Magnus goes too far in denying that ocular
lustre can be directly expressive of mental states without the
assistance of the movements of the eyebrows and lids. His own
observations show that he has overstated his thesis. We can
indeed, he says, infer from the appearance of the eyeball, “whether
the soul is agitated or calm, but we have to rely on the facial
muscles to specify the emotion. This is the reason why we can
never judge the sentiments of one who is masked; for the fire in
his eye can only indicate to us his greater or less agitation, but
not its special character. <em>That</em> we could only read in the features
which the mask conceals. It is for this reason that the orthodox
Mahometan makes his women cover up their face with a veil
which leaves nothing exposed but the eyes, because these cannot,
without the constant play of the facial muscles, indicate the emotional
state. The lustre of the corneal mirror therefore indicates
to us only the quantity, but never the quality of emotional excitement.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Herein Dr. Magnus follows the assertion of Lebrun, a contemporary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>of Louis XIV., that “the eyeball indicates by its fire
and its movements in general that the soul is passionately excited,
but not in what manner.”</p>

<p class='c001'>No doubt the Turk attains his object in leaving only the eyes
of his women open to view, for thus the passing stranger cannot
tell whether her eye flashes Love or anger. But he <em>can</em> tell
whether she is agitated or indifferent: and is not that a language
too? Do we not call music <em>the</em> “language of emotions,” although
it can only indicate the quantity of emotion, and rarely its precise
quality—just like the eyes? Therefore Dr. Magnus is wrong in
denying to the eyeball the power of emotional expression. Vague
emotion is still emotion.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has already been intimated in what manner emotional excitement
increases the eye’s lustre. It causes the blood-vessels in the
sockets of the eye to swell, thus increasing the tension of the conjunctiva
and the flow of the lachrymal fluid.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides quantitative emotion there is another thing which
ocular lustre expresses, and that is Health. It is true that
consumption, fever, and possibly other diseases may produce a
peculiar temporary transparency of complexion and ocular lustre;
but, as a rule, a bright eye indicates Health and abundant vitality.</p>

<p class='c001'>As Health is the first condition of Love, and as the ocular
lustre which indicates Health cannot be normally secured without
it, women of all times and countries have been addicted to the
habit of increasing the eye’s sparkle artificially by applying a thin
line of black paint to the edge of the lids. The ancient Egyptians,
Persians, Hindoos, Greeks, and Romans followed this custom. But
the natural sparkle which comes of Health and Beauty-sleep [<i>i.e.</i>
before midnight, with open windows] is a thousand times preferable
to such dangerous methods of tampering with the most delicate
and most easily injured organ of the body.</p>

<p class='c001'>Still another way in which the eyeball itself can express emotion
is by the varying amount on it of the lachrymal fluid, to which, in
my opinion, its lustre is chiefly owing. There is a supreme and
thrilling sparkle of the eye which can only come of the heavenly
joys of Love; but there is also “a liquid <em>melancholy</em>” of sweet
eyes, to use Bulwer’s words. Scott remarks that “Love is loveliest
when embalmed in tears;” and Dr. Magnus attests that
“especially in the eyes of lovers we often find a slight suspicion
of tears.” He traces to this fact a peculiar charm that is to be
found in the eyes of Venus, which the Greeks called ὑγρὸν (liquid,
swimming, languishing). The sculptors produced this expression
by indicating the border between the lower lid and the eyeball but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>slightly, thus giving the impression as if this border were veiled
by a liquid line of tear-fluid.</p>

<p class='c001'>What enables the lid to keep this fluid line in place is the fact
that its edge is lined with minute glands secreting an oily substance.
The presence of these glands in the upper lid, where they
cannot serve to retain lachrymal fluid, suggests the important
inference that the lustre of the eye may be partly due to a thin
film of oil spread over the cornea by the up-and-down movements
of this lid. Indeed, this may possibly be the chief cause of ocular
lustre.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the lachrymal fluid habitually present in the eye becomes
too abundant it ceases to express amorous tenderness, and becomes
instead indicative of old age, or, worse still, of intemperance.
Alcoholism has a peculiarly demoralising effect on the lower eyelid,
which becomes swollen and inflamed. This probably overstimulates
the action of the oil glands in the lids, thus accounting
for the watery or blear eye, eloquent of vice.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>b</i>) <em>Colour of the Iris.</em>—There is nothing in which popular
physiognomy takes so much delight as in pointing out what
particular characteristics are indicated by the different colours of
eyes. All such distinctions are the purest drivel. We have seen
that differences in the colour of eyes are entirely due to the varying
amount of the same pigmentary matter present in the iris. Now,
what earthly connection could a greater or less quantity of this
colouring matter have with our intellectual or moral traits? It is
necessary thus to trace facts to their last analysis in order to expose
the absurdities of current physiognomy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Inasmuch as black-eyed southern nations are, on the whole,
more impulsive than northern races, it may be said in a vague,
general way that a black eye indicates a passionate disposition.
But there are countless exceptions to this rule—apathetic black-eyed
persons, as well as, conversely, fiery blue-eyed individuals.
Nor is this at all strange; for the black colour is not stored up in
some mysterious way as a result of a fiery temperament, but is
simply accumulated in the iris through Natural Selection, as a
protection against glaring sunlight.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although, therefore, the brilliancy of the eye may vary with its
colour, the colour itself does not express emotion, either qualitatively
or quantitatively. In reading character no assistance is given us
by the fact that eyes are “of unholy blue,” “darkly divine,” “gray
as glass,” or “green as leeks.” Shakspere calls Jealousy a “green-eyed
monster”; and the green iris has indeed such a bad reputation
that blondes in search of a compliment commonly abuse their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>“green” eyes, to exercise your Gallantry, and give you a chance to
defend their “celestial blue” or “divine violet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr. Magnus suggests that the reason why we dislike decidedly
green or yellow eyes is simply because they are of rare occurrence,
and therefore appear anomalous; for in animals we do not hesitate
to pronounce such eyes beautiful. He also explains ingeniously
why it is that we are apt to attribute moral shortcomings to persons
whose eyes are of a vague, dubious colour. Such eyes displease
our æsthetic sense, and this displeasure we transfer to the moral
sense, and thus confound and prejudice our judgment. In the
same way our dislike of unusual green eyes disposes us to accuse
their owners of irregularities of conduct. Moral: Keep your
æsthetic and ethical judgments apart.</p>

<p class='c001'>Conversely, in the case of snakes, our fear and horror make it
difficult for us to appreciate the æsthetic charm of their colours.
And all these cases show that the æsthetic sense, if properly
understood and specialised, is independent of moral and utilitarian
considerations: which knocks the bottom out of the theory of
Alison, Jeffrey, and Co.</p>

<p class='c001'>One more abnormality of colour in the iris must be referred to.
It happens not infrequently that the colour of the two eyes is not
alike, one being brown, the other blue or gray. In such
cases, though each eye may be perfect in itself, we dislike the
combination. What is the ground of this æsthetic dislike? Simply
the fact that the dissimilarity of the eyes violates one of the
fundamental laws of Beauty—the law of Symmetry, which
demands that corresponding parts on the two sides of the body
should harmonise.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>c</i>) <em>Movements of the Iris.</em>—The jetblack pupil of the eye, as
already noted, is not always of the same size. It becomes smaller
if an excess of light causes the iris to relax, larger if diminution of
light makes the iris contract its fibres. Another way of altering
the size of the pupil is by gazing at a distant object, which causes
it to enlarge, while gazing at a near object makes it smaller.
According to Gratiolet and some other writers, there is still another
way in which the pupil is affected, namely, through emotional
excitement. Great fear, for instance, enlarges the pupil, according
to Gratiolet. Dr. Magnus, however, remarks that, apart from the
fact that some observers have denied that the pupil is affected by
emotions, the alterations in its size are as a rule too insignificant
to be noted by any but a trained observer; so that they could not
play any important physiognomic <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet a large pupil is everywhere esteemed a great beauty, and is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>often credited with a special power of amorous expression.
“Widened pupils,” says Kollmann, “give the eye a tender aspect;
they seem to increase its depth, and fascinate the spectator by the
strangeness this imparts to the gaze. Oriental women put atropine
into their eyes, which enlarges the pupil. They do this in order
to give their eyes the soulful expression which they believe is
imparted by large pupils, distinctly foreshadowing the joys of love.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Whether emotionally expressive or not, so much is certain that
large pupils are more beautiful than small ones, for the same reason
that large eyes are more beautiful than small ones, <i>i.e.</i> because we
cannot have too much of a thing of Beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'>Finally, there is this to be said regarding the lustre, colour, and
size of pupil and iris, that they emphasise the language of the eye.
If we play a love-song on the piano, we may admire it; but if it
is sung or played on the violoncello, it makes a doubly deep
impression; and why? Because the superior sensuous beauty of
the voice, or the amorous tone-colour of the ’cello, paints and gilds
the bare fabric of the song. A small dull-coloured eye, similarly,
may speak quite as definite a language of command or entreaty,
pride or humility, as any other; but the flashing large pupil and
the lustrous deep-dyed iris intensify the emotional impressiveness of
this language a hundredfold, by adding the incalculable power of
sensuous Beauty. Thus lustre and colour are for the <em>visible</em> music
of the spheres what orchestration is to audible music.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>d</i>) <em>Movements of the Eyeball.</em>—The socket of the eye contains
(besides the fat-cushion in which the eyeball is imbedded, the
blood-vessels, and other tissues) seven muscles; one for raising the
upper lid, and six for moving the eyeball itself upwards, downwards,
inwards, outwards, or forwards and obliquely. To the action of
these muscles the eye owes much of its expressiveness.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been noted that elating emotions have a tendency to raise
the features, depressing emotions to depress them. The eyeball is
no exception. Persons who are elated by their real or apparent
superiority to others turn their eyes habitually from the humble
things beneath them; hence the muscle which turns the eyeball
upwards has long ago received the name of “pride-muscle”; while
its antipode, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>musculus humilis</i></span>, is so called because humility
and modesty are characterised by a downward gaze.</p>

<p class='c001'>The muscle which turns the eyeball towards the inner corner,
nosewards, is much used by persons who are occupied with near
objects. If this convergence of the eyes is too pronounced, it gives
one a stupid expression; whereas, if moderate, the expression is
one of great intellectual penetration, as Dr. Magnus points out.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>He believes that the trick, made use of by some portrait-painters,
of making the eyes appear to follow you wherever you go depends
on this medium degree of convergence of the eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Slight divergence of the eyeballs, on the other hand, is characteristic
of children and of great thinkers—an item which
Schopenhauer forgot to note when he pointed out that genius
always retains certain traits of childhood. “Donders,” says Dr.
Magnus, “has always observed this divergent position of the eyes
in persons who meditate deeply. And the artists make use of this
position of the eyes to give their figures the expression of a soul
averted from terrestrial affairs, and fixed on higher spiritual objects.
Thus the Sistine Madonna has this divergent position of the eyes,
as well as the beautiful boy she carries on her arm.” It is also
found in Dürer’s portrait of himself, and in a bust of Marcus
Aurelius in the Vatican.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, however, this divergence becomes too great, it loses its
charm, for the eyes then appear to fix no object at all, and the
gaze becomes “vacant,” as in the eyes of the blind or the sick.
To appreciate the force of these remarks it must be borne in mind
that there is only one part of the retina, called the “yellow spot,”
with which we can distinctly fix an object. What we see with
other parts of the retina is indistinct, blurred.</p>

<p class='c001'>These details are here given because many will be glad to know
that by daily exercising the muscles of the eyeballs before the
mirror, they can greatly alter and improve their looks. Every day
one hears the remark, “She has beautiful eyes, but she does not
know how to use them.” When we read of a great thinker, like
Kant, fixing his gaze immovably on a tree for an hour, we think it
quite natural; nor does any one object to “the poet’s eye, in a fine
frenzy rolling,” for we all know that a poet is merely an inspired
madman. But a young lady who wishes to charm by her Beauty
must learn to fix her wandering eyes calmly on others, while
avoiding a stony stare. One of the greatest charms of American
girls is their frank, steady gaze, free from any tinge of unfeminine
boldness. Such a charming natural gaze can only be acquired in
a country where girls are taught to look upon men as gentlemen,
and not as wolves, against whom they must be guarded by dragons.</p>

<p class='c001'>Eye-gymnastics are as important to Beauty as lung-gymnastics
to Health, and dancing-lessons to Grace. But of course there is a
certain number of fortunate girls who can dispense with such
exercises, because they gradually learn the proper use of their eyes,
as well as general graceful movements, from the example of a
refined mother.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>Goldsmith’s pretty line about “the bashful virgin’s sidelong
looks of love,” is not a mere poetic conceit, but a scientific <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>aperçu</i></span>;
for, as Professor Kollmann remarks, “the external straight muscle
of the eye was also called the lover’s muscle, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>musculus amatorius</i></span>,
because the furtive side-glance is aimed at a beloved person.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor is this the only way in which the movements of the eyeball
are concerned with Romantic Love. By constantly exercising
certain muscles of the eyeball in preference to others, the eyes
gradually assume, when at rest, a fixed and peculiar gaze which
distinguishes them from all other eyes. It is comparatively easy
to find two pairs of eyes of the same colour or form, but two with
the same gaze, <i>i.e.</i> characteristic position of the eyeballs, never.
Hence Dr. Magnus boldly generalises Herder’s statement that
“Every great man has a look which no one but he can give with
his eyes,” into the maxim that “<em>Every individual</em> has a look which
no one else can make with his eyes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bungling photographers commonly spoil their pictures by compelling
their victims to fix their eyes in an unwonted position.
The result is a picture which bears some general resemblance to
the victim, but in which the characteristic <em>individual</em> expression is
wanting.</p>

<p class='c001'>Our habit of masking our eyes alone when we wish to remain
unrecognised, and leaving the lower part of the face exposed,
affords another proof of the assertion that the eye is the chief seat
of individuality. For though the eyeball itself remains visible, the
surrounding parts are covered, so that its characteristic position
cannot be determined.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now we know that Individual Preference is the first and most
essential element of Romantic Love. Hence Dante was as correct
in calling the eyes “the beginning of Love,” as in terming the lips
“the end of Love.” And Shakspere agrees with Dante when he
speaks of “Love first learned in a lady’s eyes”; and again: “But
for her eye I would not love her; yes, for her two eyes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>e</i>) <em>Movements of the Eyelids.</em>—Although the foregoing pages
considerably qualify Dr. Magnus’s thesis that the eyeball owes all
its life and expressiveness to the movements of the eyelids and
brows, yet the physiognomic and æsthetic importance of lids,
lashes, and brows can hardly be too much emphasised. A very
large proportion of the pleasure we derive from beautiful eyes is
due to the constant changes in the apparent size of the eyeball,
and the gradations in its lustre, produced by the rapid movements
of the upper lid. This is strikingly proved by the fact, noted by
Dr. Magnus, “that the eyes of wax figures, be they ever so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>artistically finished, always give the impression of death and
rigidity,” whereas “artificial eyes, such as are often inserted by
physicians after the loss of an eye, have, thanks to the constant
play of the lids, an appearance so animated and lifelike that it
requires the trained eye of a specialist to detect the dead, lifeless
glass-eye in this apparently so animated orb.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A complete emotional scale is symbolised in these movements of
the upper eyelids. A medium position indicates rest or indifference.
Joyous and other exciting emotions raise them, so that the
whole of the lustrous iris becomes visible. Thus we get the eye
“sparkling with joy” or the “angry flash of the eye,” as well as
Cupid’s darts: “He is already dead; stabbed with a white wench’s
black eye.” “Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye than twenty
of their swords.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But if the lids are raised too high, so that the white above the
iris becomes visible, the expression changes to one of affectation,
or maniacal wildness, or extreme terror. There are persons, says
Magnus, in whom the aperture between the lids is naturally so
wide as to reveal the upper white of the eyes; and in consequence
we are apt to accuse them of hollow pathos. I have seen not a
few beautiful pairs of eyes marred by the habitual tendency to
raise the lids too much—a fault that can be readily overcome by
deliberate effort and practice before the mirror.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, if the aperture between the lids is too small,
that is, if the lids are naturally (or only transiently) lowered too
much, we get an apathetic, drowsy expression. The Chinese eye
displeases us not only by its oblique set, and the narrowness of the
lid, but also because the natural smallness of the eyeball is
exaggerated by the narrow palpebral aperture. The negro appears
more wide awake to us, because in his eyes this aperture is wider—so
wide, in fact, that he is apt to displease us by showing too
much of the white sclerotic.</p>

<p class='c001'>A very drooping eyelid being expressive of fatigue, physical or
mental, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>blasé</i></span> persons affect it in order to indicate their <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>nil
admirari</i></span> attitude. But there is another secret reason why they
drop their eyelids. If we lower the head and open our eyes widely,
they retire within their sockets and appear hollow, suggesting dissipation
or disease; whereas, if we raise the head, throwing it
slightly backwards, and lowering the eyelids, we obliterate this
hollow, and give the impression of languid indifference. This,
rather than the “raising of the eyebrows,” is what constitutes the
“supercilious” expression.</p>

<p class='c001'>It cannot be said that a supercilious appearance is specially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>attractive, yet the obliteration of the eyes’ hollowness is an advantage;
and it may be added that, since perfect health is not a superabundant
phenomenon, the same reasoning explains why many
faces are so much more fascinating in a reclining or semi-reclining
position than when upright. Fashion, of course, being the handmaid
of ugliness, does not object to hollow eyes encircled by blue
rings, but even cultivates them. Yet in her heart of hearts every
fashionable woman knows that nothing so surely kills masculine
admiration—not to speak of Love—as sunken eyes with blue
rings.</p>

<p class='c001'>A slight drooping of the eyelids, on the other hand, gives a
pleasing expression of amorous languor. The lid, with its lashes,
in this case, coyly veils the lustre of the eye, without extinguishing
it. Hence, in the words of Dr. Magnus, the sculptors of antiquity
made use of this slight lowering of the lid to express sensuous
love; and accordingly it was customary to chisel the eyes of Venus
with drooping lids and a small aperture.</p>

<p class='c001'>In their task of moderating and varying the lustre of the eyeball,
the lids are greatly assisted by the lashes. An eye with
missing or too short lashes is apt to appear too fiery, glaring, or
“stinging.” Long dark eyelashes are of all the means of flirtation
the most irresistible. Note yonder artful maiden. How modestly
and coyly she droops her eyes, till suddenly the fringed curtain is
raised and a glorious symphony of colour and lustre is flashed on
her poor companion’s dazed vision! No wonder he staggers and
falls in love at first sight.</p>

<p class='c001'>“White lashes and eyebrows are so disagreeably suggestive,”
we read in the <cite>Ugly Girl Papers</cite>, “that one cannot blame their
possessor for disguising them by a harmless device. A decoction
of walnut juice should be made in season, and kept in a bottle for
use the year round. It is to be applied with a small hair-pencil
to the brows and lashes, turning them to a rich brown, which harmonises
with fair hair.” Another recipe given, by a good authority,
is as follows: “Take frankincense, resin, pitch, of each one half
ounce; gum mastic, quarter of an ounce; mix and drop on red-hot
charcoals. Receive the fumes in a large funnel, and a black
powder will adhere to its sides. Mix this with fresh juice of
alderberries (or Cologne water will do), and apply with a fine
camel-hair brush.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Those who wish to make their lashes longer and more regular
may find the following suggestions, by Drs. Brinton and Napheys,
of use: “The eyelashes should be examined one by one, and any
which are split, or crooked, or feeble, should be trimmed with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>pair of sharp scissors. The base of the lashes should be anointed
nightly with a minute quantity of oil of cajuput on the top of a
camel-hair brush, and the examination and trimming repeated
every month. If this is sedulously carried out for a few months
the result will be gratifying.”</p>

<p class='c001'>All such operations should be performed by another person, for
the eye is a most delicate organ. Yet, not even this organ has
been spared by deforming Fashion. The fact that some Africans
colour their eyelids black may have a utilitarian rather than a
cosmetic reason. But what shall we say to the Africans who
eradicate their eyebrows, and the Paraguayans, who remove their
eyelashes because they “do not wish to be like horses?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Twin sisters ever are Fashion and Idiocy.</p>

<p class='c001'>(<i>f</i>) <em>Movements of the Eyebrows.</em>—Herder called the arched eyebrow
the rainbow of peace, because if it is straightened by a frown
it portends a storm. In plain prose, the eyebrow partakes of the
general upward movement from joyous excitement, and the downward
movement in grief. If the eyebrows are too bushy, they
overshadow the eye and produce a gloomy or even ferocious appearance.
The Chinese, possibly from an instinctive perception that
their eyes are not too large or bright, shave their eyebrows, leaving
only a narrow fringe. Dr. Broca also notes that the eyebrow adds
to the oblique appearance of the Chinese eye through a particular
movement, the two internal thirds of the eyebrows being lower,
and the external third higher than with us.</p>

<p class='c001'>Though not, perhaps, directly concerned in the expression of
Love, the eyebrow is not to be under-rated. No detail of Beauty
escapes Cupid’s eyes; for do we not read of “the lover, sighing
like furnace, with a woeful ballad made to his mistress’s eyebrows”?</p>

<h3 class='c014'>COSMETIC HINTS</h3>

<p class='c013'>As modern lovers disapprove of eyebrows meeting over the nose,
superfluous hairs should be removed. Coarse irregular hairs in
any part of the eyebrow should be pulled out or kept in position
by a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>fixateur</i></span>. “It is not well to trim the eyebrow generally,
as it makes it coarse.... When it is desired to thicken or
strengthen them, two or three drops of oil of cajuput may be
gently rubbed into the skin every other night; but here, and
<em>always</em> when wiping them, the rubbing should be in the direction
of the hair, from the nose outward, and <em>never</em> in the reverse
direction.” Among harmless dyes, pencils of dark pomatum or
walnut-bark, steeped in Cologne for a week, are recommended;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>or, for a transient effect, a needle smoked over the flame of a
candle may be used.</p>

<p class='c001'>Regarding the general hygienic care of the eye, the following
rules should be borne in mind. Never read or work in a too weak
or too glaring light, or when lying down, or with the book too near
the eye. Rest the muscles occasionally by looking at a distant
object. Bathe the eyes every morning in cold water, <em>keeping them
closed</em>. For disorders, consult a physician immediately; a day’s
delay may be fatal to ocular beauty. For ordinary inflammation,
an external application of witch-hazel extract, mixed with a few
drops of Cologne, is very soothing. <em>Never</em> sleep with your eyes
facing the window. Ninety-nine persons in a hundred do so;
hence the large number of weak, lustreless eyes, early disturbances
of slumber, and morning headaches. Large numbers of tourists in
Switzerland constantly suffer from headaches, and lose all the
benefits of their vacation, simply because they fail to have their
head at night in the centre of the room, where it ought to be,
because the air circulates there more freely than near the wall.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE HAIR</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>CAUSE OF MAN’S NUDITY</h3>

<p class='c013'>“From the presence of the woolly hair or lanugo on the human
f&oelig;tus, and of rudimentary hairs scattered over the body during
maturity,” Darwin inferred that “man is descended from some
animal which was born hairy and remained so during life.” He
believed that “the loss of hair is an inconvenience and probably an
injury to man, even in a hot climate, for he is thus exposed to the
scorching in the sun, and to sudden chills, especially during wet
weather. As Mr. Wallace remarks, the natives in all countries are
glad to protect their naked backs and shoulders with some slight
covering. No one supposes that the nakedness of the skin is any
direct advantage to man; his body, therefore, cannot have been
divested of hair through Natural Selection.” Accordingly, he concludes
that man lost his hairy covering through Sexual Selection,
for ornamental purposes.</p>

<p class='c001'>But if it can be shown that the nakedness of his skin <em>is</em> in some
way of advantage to man, this argument falls to the ground.
There are sufficient reasons, I think, for believing that Natural
Selection aided Sexual Selection in divesting man of his hairy coat.</p>

<p class='c001'>With his usual candour Darwin noticed the evidence which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>seemed to tell against his view. Mr. Belt, he says, “believes that
within the tropics it is an advantage to man to be destitute of hair,
as he is thus enabled to free himself of the multitude of ticks
(acari) and other parasites with which he is often infested, and
which sometimes cause ulceration.” Darwin doubts, however,
whether this evil is of sufficient magnitude to have led to the
denudation of the body through Natural Selection, “since none of
the many quadrupeds inhabiting the tropics have, as far as I
know, acquired any specialised means of relief.” But as primitive
man’s habits of cleanliness are much inferior to those of animals,
this objection loses its force; and it is, moreover, weakened by the
testimony of Sir W. Denison that “it is said to be a practice with
the Australians, when the vermin get troublesome, to singe themselves.”
We also know that the ancient <a id='corr487.14'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Egyptains'>Egyptians</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_487.14'><ins class='correction' title='Egyptains'>Egyptians</ins></a></span> shaved off their
hair from motives of cleanliness.</p>

<p class='c001'>However, it is not likely that the superior advantages of cleanliness
and freedom from parasites would alone have sufficed to
produce so great a change in man as the loss of his hair. It is
more probable that the sun was the chief agent in accomplishing
this transformation. I fail to see the force of Darwin’s contention
that the fact that “the other members of the order of Primates, to
which man belongs, although inhabiting various hot regions, are
well clothed with hair, generally thickest on the upper surface, is
opposed to the supposition that man became naked through the
action of the sun.” For these animals commonly live in forests
and on trees, where they are protected from the rays of the sun,
which is not the case with man.</p>

<p class='c001'>Furthermore, Darwin himself mentions some circumstances
which point to the conclusion that the sun is the cause of man’s
nudity. He says, for instance, that “elephants and rhinoceroses
are almost hairless; and as certain extinct species which formerly
lived under an arctic climate were covered with long wool or hair,
it would almost appear as if the existing species of both genera
had lost their hairy covering from exposure to heat. This appears
the more probable as the elephants in India which live on elevated
and cool districts are more hairy than those on the lowlands.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bearing in mind what was said in the chapter on the Complexion
regarding the negro’s skin, there is no difficulty in understanding
why Natural Selection should eliminate the hairy covering
of the skin while favouring a dark complexion. Hair not only
absorbs the sun’s heat, but retains that of the body; hence a hairy
man not living on trees would be very uncomfortable in Africa,
and likely to succumb to the enervating effects of high temperature.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>The negro’s naked skin, on the other hand, is, as we have seen,
specially devised as a <em>body-cooler</em>. The black pigment protects
the underlying nerves of temperature, while the solar heat absorbed
by this pigment is immediately radiated in the form of perspiration.
Now we can see not only why the negro’s skin is more velvety,
smooth, and hairless than our own, but why its sweat-pores are
larger and more numerous than in our skin.</p>

<p class='c001'>At a later stage of evolution Sexual Selection probably came in
to aid in this process of denudation. We may infer this, in the
first place, from the analogous case of apes who have denuded and
variously-coloured patches on the head and elsewhere, which they
use for purposes of display, to attract the notice of the opposite
sex; in the second place, from the fact that there are not a few
tribes who pluck out their hairs. “The Fuegians threatened a
young missionary, who was left for a time with them, to strip him
naked, and pluck the hairs from his face and body, yet he was far
from being a hairy man;” and “throughout the world the races
which are almost completely destitute of a beard, dislike hairs on
the face and body, and take pains to eradicate them.” Darwin
also notes some facts which, by analogy, seem to make it probable
that “the long-continued habit of eradicating the hair may have
produced an inherited effect.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the case of the white race we cannot rely so much on the
action of the sun as accounting for the absence of hair, but must
place more especial emphasis on Sexual Selection. We are warranted
in doing this by the consideration that Taste for Beauty is
more developed in the white race, and therefore has more influence
in controlling the choice of a mate. “As the body in woman is
less hairy than in man, and as this character is common to all
races, we may conclude” with Darwin “that it was our female
semi-human ancestors who were first divested of hair,” this
character being then transmitted by the mothers to their children
of both sexes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The two universal traits of Beauty which chiefly guided man in
the preference of a hairless skin were evidently Smoothness and
Colour. One need only compare for a moment the face of a female
chimpanzee, its leathery folded skin and straggling hairs, with the
smooth and rosy complexion of a European damsel, to understand
that, leaving touch out of consideration, sight alone would have
sufficed to give the preference to the hairless skin. But since we
derive less direct advantage than the tropical races from such a
skin, cases of reversion to the hairy type are more common among
us than with them, and our bodies in general are more hairy.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>BEARDS AND MOUSTACHES</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The elimination of hair from those parts of the body where it is
less beautiful than a nude skin, is only one of the functions of
Sexual Selection. Another equally important function is the preservation
and elongation of the hair in a few places for ornamental
purposes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We know from Eschricht,” says Darwin, “that with mankind
the female as well as the male f&oelig;tus is furnished with much hair
on the face, especially round the mouth; and this indicates that
we are descended from progenitors of whom <em>both sexes were bearded</em>.
It appears, therefore, at first sight, probable that man has retained
his beard from a very early period, whilst woman lost her
beard at the same time that her body became almost completely
divested of hair.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A long beard serves, to some extent, to protect the throat, but
a moustache serves no such use, and it seems therefore more probable
that beards as well as moustaches were developed in man for
ornamental purposes, as in many monkeys (see, for some very
curious pictures of bearded monkeys, <cite>Descent of Man</cite>, chap. xviii.)
But why should women have lost their beards while men retained
theirs? Because of the importance of emphasising the secondary
sexual differences between man and woman, on which the degree
of amorous infatuation depends. The tendency of evolution, as we
have seen, has been to make the sexes more and more different in
appearance; and as man chooses his mate chiefly on <em>æsthetic</em>
grounds, he habitually gave the preference to smooth-faced women,
whereas woman’s choice, being largely based on <em>dynamic</em> grounds,
fell on the bearded and moustached men, since a luxurious growth
of hair is commonly a sign of physical vigour. Hence the humiliation
of the young man who cannot raise a moustache, and the
reciprocal horror of the young lady who finds the germs of one on
her lip. Both are instinctively afraid of being “boycotted” by
Cupid, and for ever debarred from the pleasures of mutual Romantic
Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>Women are quite right in dreading hair in the face as a blemish,
for it is not only objectionable as a masculine trait, but also as a characteristic
of old age, a hairy face being quite a common attribute
of aged females. But with men the case is different. Though
women may still be often influenced in their amorous choice by a
beard, it is not, as just pointed out, on æsthetic grounds; and it
is indeed very dubious if the beard can be accepted as a real personal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>ornament. True, the ancient Greeks respected a beard as an
attribute of maturity and manhood, but their ideal of <em>supreme</em>
beauty was nevertheless an unbearded youth: Apollo has neither
beard nor moustache. The ancient Egyptians had a horror of the
bearded and long-haired Greeks. “No Egyptian of either sex
would on any account kiss the lips of a Greek,” and whenever the
Egyptians “intended to convey the idea of a man of low condition,
or a slovenly person, the artists represented him with a beard”
(Wilkinson). Similarly, in the second edition of his <cite>Anatomy of
Expression</cite> (1824), Sir Charles Bell wrote that “When those
essays were first written there was not a beard to be seen in
England unless joined with squalor and neglect, and I had the
conviction that this appendage <em>concealed the finest features</em>. Being
in Rome, however, during the procession of the Corpus Domini, I
saw that the expression was not injured by the beard, but that it
added to the dignity and character of years.”</p>

<p class='c001'>These two sentences contain the whole philosophy of beards.
The expression of character is not injured, but rather increased by
a beard; but if it conceals the fine features of youth it is objectionable.
There are men whose faces are too wide, and whose
appearance is therefore improved by a chin-beard; and there are
others whose faces are too narrow, and who consequently look
better with side-whiskers. But in a well-shaped youthful masculine
face a beard is as great a superfluity, if not a blemish, as in a
woman’s face.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, since the faces of civilised races are undoubtedly becoming
more beautiful as time advances, it is comforting to know that,
notwithstanding female selection, the beard is gradually disappearing.
Very few men are able to raise a fine beard to-day, even
with the artificial stimulus of several years’ daily shaving; and the
time, no doubt, is not very distant when men will go to the cosmetic
electrician to have their straggling hairbulbs in the chin
killed. This may produce an inherited effect on their children;
and the always smooth-faced mother, too, cannot but exert some
hereditary influence on her sons as well as her daughters. The
women, in turn, will inherit some of the superior æsthetic Taste of
the men, and begin to see that there is more charm in a smooth
than in a bearded face; while there will still be room enough for
those sexual differences in facial Beauty which feed the flame of
Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>The following newspaper paragraph, though it may be a mere
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>jeu d’esprit</i></span>, is amusing and suggestive: “A Frenchman sent a
circular to all his friends asking why they cultivated a beard.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>Among the answers 9 stated, ‘Because I wish to avoid shaving’;
12 ‘Because I do not wish to catch cold’; 5 ‘Because I wish to
conceal bad teeth’; ‘Because I wish to conceal the length of my
nose’; 6 ‘Because I am a soldier’; 21 ‘Because I was a soldier’;
65 ‘Because my wife likes it’; 28 ‘Because my love likes it’; 15
answered that they wore no beards.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Moustaches are much more common to-day than beards, and it
is barely possible that they may escape æsthetic condemnation, and
survive to the millennium. Persons with very short upper lips or
flat noses, it is true, only emphasise their shortcomings by wearing
a moustache; but in broad faces with prominent noses a well-shaped,
not too drooping, moustache is no doubt an ornament, relieving
the gravity of the masculine features and adding to their
expression. As Bell remarks: “Although the hair of the upper
lip does conceal the finer modulations of the mouth, as in woman,
it adds to the character of the stronger and harsher emotions.”
“I was led to attend more particularly to the moustache as a
feature of expression,” he says, “in meeting a handsome young French
soldier coming up a long ascent in the Côte d’Or, and breathing
hard, although with a good-humoured, innocent expression. His
sharp-pointed black moustache rose and fell with a catamount look
that set me to think on the cause.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Young men may find in Bell’s remarks a suggestion as to how they
may make the moustache a permanent ornament of the human race.
The movements of the moustache are dependent on the muscle called
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>depressor alæ nasi</i></span>. By specially cultivating this muscle men
might in course of time make the movements of the moustaches
subject to voluntary control. Just think what a capacity for
emotional expression lies in such a simple organ as the dog’s caudal
appendage, aptly called the “psychographic tail” by Vischer: and
moustaches are double, and therefore equal to two psychographic
appendages!</p>

<p class='c001'>Sexual Selection would not fail to seize on this “new departure”
in moustaches immediately in order to emphasise the sexual differences
of expression in the face, and thus increase the ardour of
romantic passion. A few days ago I came across an attempt in a
German paper to explain the meaning of the word Flirtation. The
writer derives the word from an old expression meaning to toss or
cast about. This he refers to the eyes, and thinks that the proper
translation of Flirtation is <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>äugeln</i></span>, <i>i.e.</i> to “make eyes.” We, of
course, know that flirting is a fine art which includes a vast deal
besides <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>äugeln</i></span>; but “making eyes” is certainly one of its tricks.
Now, is it not probable that by and by, when young men will have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>properly trained their <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>depressor alæ nasi</i></span>, they will look upon the
making of eyes as a feminine attribute, and, instead of winking at
their sweethearts, express their admiration by some subtle and
graceful movement of the moustaches? This would obliterate
Darwin’s assertion that Love has no special means of expression.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>BALDNESS AND DEPILATORIES</h3>

<p class='c013'>Superficial students of Darwinism are constantly making owlish
predictions that ere many generations will have passed bald heads
will be the normal aspect of man. But, as we have just seen in
the case of beards, it is not utility or Natural Selection so much
as Sexual, Æsthetico-Amorous Selection on which the evolution of
Personal Beauty depends. If Natural Selection were at work alone
we should, indeed, ultimately become bald; for as soon as man
begins to cover his head with a cap or hat, he takes away the chief
function of the hair on the top of the head, where it serves as a
protection against wind and weather. But Sexual Selection now
steps in and says that the hair must remain, because without it the
head looks decidedly ugly, whatever its shape.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Eschricht states that in the human f&oelig;tus the hair on the face
during the fifth month is longer than that on the head; and this
indicates that our semi-human progenitors were not furnished with
long tresses, which must therefore have been a late acquisition.
This is likewise indicated by the extraordinary difference in the
length of the hair in the different races: in the negro the hair
forms a mere curly mat; with us it is of great length, and with
the American natives it not rarely reaches to the ground. Some
species of Semnopithecus have their head covered with moderately
long hair, and this probably serves as an ornament, and was acquired
through sexual selection. The same view may perhaps be
extended to mankind, for we know that long tresses are now and
were formerly much admired, as may be observed in the works of
almost every poet; St. Paul says, ‘If a woman have long hair it
is a glory to her;’ and we have seen that in North America a
chief was elected solely from the length of his hair” (Darwin).</p>

<p class='c001'>Inasmuch as Sexual Selection or Love is impeded in its action
not only by pecuniary and social considerations, but by the fact
that it cannot be guided by any particular feature alone, its action
is slow and sometimes uncertain. Hence the increase of bald
heads. It is therefore necessary to supplement the beautifying
results of Sexual Selection by means of hygienic precautions, such
as avoiding air-tight, warm, high hats, badly ventilated rooms,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>intemperate habits, and other causes of baldness. Hereditary
baldness is difficult to arrest in its course; but even in such cases
much may be accomplished by beginning in childhood to take
proper care of the hair. Most persons—especially men—seem to
imagine that combs and brushes are made solely for the purpose
of arranging the hair in some approved fashion; whereas, if properly
used, a brush adds as much to the <em>sensuous</em> beauty of the
hair as to its <em>formal</em> appearance. To remove all the dust from
the hair, and give it gloss and healthy colour, about fifty daily
strokes, or more even, are recommended. Avoid irritating the
scalp with fine combs or hard bristles, and wash it once or twice
a week with a weak solution of ammonia or borax. Hair that is
properly brushed is always glossy with its natural oil, and needs
no vulgar ointment, offensive to the smell and suggestive of uncleanliness.
If with these hygienic precautions the hair refuses to
become beautiful, it is time to get medical advice; for the dull
colour and dryness of the hair which lead to baldness are often
due to constitutional disease.</p>

<p class='c001'>Powdering the hair is fortunately no longer in vogue as it was
formerly. It is a most unæsthetic habit, not only because white
or gray hair is naturally suggestive of old age, grief, and decrepitude,
but because the flour forms with the perspiration and with
the oil of the hair a nasty compound. William Pitt “estimated,
in 1795, that the amount of flour annually consumed for this
purpose in the United Kingdom represented the enormous and
incredible value of six million dollars.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is estimated that the average number of hairs on the head
is 120,000. This allows one to look with considerable indifference
on the loss of a few hundred, all the more as in ordinary cases,
even after illness, every hair lost is replaced by another. But
when the papilla at the base of the hair cavity is destroyed, then
baldness is inevitable. It follows from this that the only certain
way of removing hair permanently from places where it is not
desired is to destroy this papilla. “Plucking hair out by the
root” does not destroy it. “If they are pulled out with the
tweezers there is a still greater stimulus given,” says Dr. Bulkley
(<cite>The Skin in Health and Disease</cite>), “and the hairs return yet
more coarse and obtrusive.” The various Oriental and Occidental
pastes for removing the hair have no more permanent effect than
shaving. “Superfluous hairs can be removed either by the introduction
of an irregularly-shaped needle into the follicle (after
the extraction of the hair), which is then twisted so as to break
up the papilla and produce a little inflammation, which closes the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>follicle; or a needle can be inserted, and a current from a battery
be turned on, when the follicle is destroyed by what is known as
electrolysis. These procedures could be done only by a physician.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Concerning electrolysis Dr. S. E. Woody says in the <cite>American
Practitioner and News</cite> that the number of hairs to return and
demand a second removal will decrease with the skill of the
operator and the thoroughness of the operation. He usually
expects the return of about 5 per cent, but when these are in
turn removed the cure is complete. “You should have the patient
come only on bright days, for good light is necessary.”</p>

<p class='c001'>ÆSTHETIC VALUE OF HAIR</p>

<p class='c001'>If not the most beautiful part of the head, hair certainly is the
most beautifying. To improve the shape of mouth, nose, chin, or
eyes requires time and patience, but the arrangement of the hair
can be altered in a minute, not only to its own advantage, but so
as to enhance the beauty of the whole face. By clever manipulation
of her long tresses, a woman can alter her appearance almost
as completely as a man can by shaving off his long beard or
moustache.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, alas! If the prevalence of the bustle and wasp-waist
allowed any doubt to remain as to the woful rarity of æsthetic
taste among women, it would be found in the arrangement of the
hair and the kind of head-dresses they commonly adopt at the
behest of Fashion. “Because women as a rule do not know what
<em>beauty</em> means,” says Mrs. Haweis (<cite>The Art of Beauty</cite>), “therefore
they catch at whatever presents itself as a novelty.... They do
not pause to consider whether the old fashion became them better—whether
the new one reveals more clearly the slight shrinking
of the jaw, or spoils the pretty colour still blooming in the
cheek.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The latest head-dress foisted on the feminine world by Parisian
Fashion shows most strikingly how Fashion is the Handmaid of
Vulgarity as well as of Ugliness. Heaven knows, the high silk
hats worn by men are bad enough, on hygienic as well as æsthetic
grounds. They promote baldness and destroy all the artistic proportions
of stature, making the head look by one half too high.
But silk hats are a harmless trifle compared with the shapeless
straw-towers, ornamented with bird-corpses, that have been worn
of late by almost all women in countries which slavishly follow
Parisian example. And there is this great difference between
man’s silk hat and woman’s bird-sarcophagus—the former only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>results in ugliness, the second is also evidence of heartlessness,
and leads to vulgarity. For what is it but vulgarity if women
continue to go to the theatre for two winters with hats which
make it quite impossible for those sitting behind them to see the
scenery and enjoy the play—and all this in spite of innumerable
sarcastic and angry protests in the journals? Is not the first rule
of etiquette and good manners regard for the feelings and pleasures
of others?</p>

<p class='c001'>What would women say to a man who kept on his tall hat in
a theatre until the ushers threw him out? Would they not all
pronounce him either intoxicated or ineffably vulgar? Would not
Schopenhauer, if he could go to an American theatre to-day, be
justified in saying that women are not only the “unæsthetic sex,”
but also the “ill-bred sex”? And can the women who are so
devoid of courtesy towards the men wonder that masculine gallantry
towards women on street-cars and elsewhere seems to be on the
wane?</p>

<p class='c001'>Although there are no two heads in which the most pleasing
effect is secured by precisely the same arrangement of the hair
and the same style of hat, it may be laid down as a universal rule
that a very high hat or arrangement of the hair is becoming to no
one, for the reason above indicated. Let it be observed, says Mr.
Buskin, “that in spite of all custom, an Englishman instantly
acknowledges, and at first sight, the superiority of the turban to
the hat.” “Guido,” says Mrs. Haweis, “probably felt the
peculiar charm of the turban when he placed one upon the quiet
melancholy head of Beatrice Cenci.” For full and bright young
faces the Tam o’ Shanter is the loveliest of all head-dresses. But
this subject is too large to be discussed in a paragraph. In Mrs.
Haweis’s <cite>Art of Beauty</cite> may be found some elegant illustrations
of head-dresses placed near fashionable monstrosities; and young
ladies would do well to devote an hour a day for a year or two to
the study of some history of costume. Nothing awakens the sense
of Beauty so rapidly as good models and comparisons.</p>

<p class='c001'>Concerning the arrangement of the hair two more points may
be noted. Is it not about time to do away with the venerable
absurdity of parting the hair? If entire baldness is voted ugly,
why should partial baldness be courted? The hair should be
allowed to remain in its natural direction of growth. It does not
part itself naturally, nor again—and this is a much more important
point—does it grow backward from the forehead. The
Chinese coiffure disfigures <em>every</em> woman who adopts it; and the
habit of combing back the hair tightly from the forehead, moreover,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>often causes neuralgic headache, the cause of which is unsuspected;
not to speak of the fact that such a coiffure raises the
eyebrows, and thus gives a fixed expression of amazed stupefaction.
The hair naturally falls over the forehead, and fringes it as
beautifully as a grove does a lake.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ancient Greek notions on this subject are worthy of attentive
consideration. “Women who had a high forehead placed a
band over it, with the design of making it thereby seem lower,”
says Winckelmann. Not only in women but in mature men the
hair was so arranged as to cover up “the receding bare corners
over the temples, which usually enlarge as life advances beyond
that age when the forehead is naturally high.” The modern
fringe or “bang” is, however, an improvement even on the Greek
curve of the hair over the temples. It improves the appearance
of all women except those whose forehead is very low naturally;
but in all cases exaggeration must be avoided.</p>

<p class='c001'>A writer in the London <cite>Evening Standard</cite> thinks it is strange
that the English, “who have the poorest hair in Europe, make
the least attempt to show what they have,” and that it has now
“come to such a pass that a maiden of twenty thinks it almost
indecent to wear her hair loose.” He traces this to the tyranny
of Fashion—the ugly majority having compelled the beautiful
minority to conceal their charms. But we may be sure that ere
long Beauty will revolt against Fashion. It will be another French
revolution, practically,—an emphatic protest against Parisian
dictation and vulgarity.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>BLONDE <i>VERSUS</i> BRUNETTE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Becker tells us that among the ancient Greeks “black was
probably the prevailing colour of the hair, though blond is
frequently mentioned”; and he adds that both men and women
used dyes, and “the blond or yellow hair was much admired.”
Mr. Gladstone, in his work on Homer, remarks that “dark hair is
a note of the foreigner and of Southern extraction.... I have
been assured that, in the Greece of to-day, light hair is still held
as indicating the purest Hellenic blood.” According to Winckelmann,
“Homer does not even once mention hair of a black colour”;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>and again: "Flaxen, ξανθὴ hair has always been considered the
most beautiful; and hair of this colour has been attributed to the
most beautiful of the gods, as Apollo and Bacchus, not less than
to the heroes; even Alexander had flaxen hair."</p>

<p class='c001'>That the Romans agreed with the Greeks in giving the preference
to light hair seems probable from the extensive importations
of yellow German hair for the Roman ladies, as also from the fact
that “Lucretius, when speaking of the false flatteries addressed to
women, quotes one in illustration, namely, that a maiden with
black hair is μελίχροος (honey-coloured)—thus ascribing to her a
beauty which she does not possess.”</p>

<p class='c001'>When the fair-haired Teuton overran the South a new motive
for preferring blond hair arose, as a writer in the London <cite>Standard</cite>
remarks: “Whatever the feeling of the men, we may be sure that
the dark beauties of those climes felt a natural inclination to
resemble the wives and daughters of the conqueror, and when we
perceive their likenesses again, at the revival of art in Italy, not a
black tress is to be seen. Is there a single Madonna not blond?—or
ten portraits of women by the great masters? In all the
gallery of Titian, we think only of a figure, naked to the waist, in
the Uffizi, described as one of his mistresses.... But we know
that the blond tint was artificial in a majority of cases—the deep
black of eye and brow would show it if no evidence were forthcoming.
But evidence turns up at every side ... a hundred
recipes are found in memoirs, correspondence, and treatises of the
time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Hear another witness: “Southern Europe,” says Mr. R. G.
White, “is peopled with dark-skinned, dark-haired races, and the
superior beauty of the blond type was recognised by the painters,
who always, from the earliest days, represented angels as of that
type. The Devil was painted black so much as a matter of course
that his pictured appearance gave rise to a well-known proverb;
ordinary mortals were represented as more or less dark; celestial
people were white and golden-haired: whence the epithet ‘divinely
fair.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>And the poets were quite as partial as the artists to the light
type. Petrarch’s sonnets are addressed to a blue-eyed Laura.
Krimhild of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Nibelungenlied</cite></span> is blue-eyed, like Fricka, the
Northern Juno, and Ingeborg of the <cite>Frithjof’s Saga</cite>, and the
Danish princess Iolanthe, as Dr. Magnus points out; and in the
French folk-songs “the girls are almost as invariably blond as in
the songs of Heine,” as a writer in the <cite>Saturday Review</cite> (1878)
remarks, adding that “there is even such an expression as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>aller en
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>blonde</i></span>, ‘to go a-wooing,’ which proves the universality of the
belief in fair beauties.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Concerning England, a writer in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> declares
that Shakspere mentions black hair only twice throughout his
plays; and that in the National Gallery of that date (1853) there
was not a single female head with black hair.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>BRUNETTE <i>VERSUS</i> BLONDE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Thus we have evidence showing that during the epoch preceding
the general prevalence of Romantic Love, the blond type was considered
the ideal of beauty throughout Europe—in Greece and
Italy as well as in Germany, Scandinavia, France, and England.
And where the hair was not naturally blond, artificial means were
used to make it so.</p>

<p class='c001'>But as soon as Love appears on the scene and sharpens the
æsthetic sense, we find a reaction in favour of brunettes. There
can be no doubt of this, for it is attested not only by personal
opinions and observations, but by accurate statistics. The
<cite>Quarterly Review</cite> just referred to believed that blondes were
gradually decreasing in England, and the <cite>Saturday Review</cite> asserts
that “some years ago Mr. Gladstone, whom nothing escapes,
declared that light-haired people were far less numerous than in
his youth. Many middle-aged persons will probably agree with
him.” “The time was,” the writer adds, “when the black-haired,
black-eyed girl of fiction was as dark of soul as of tresses, while
the blue-eyed maiden’s character was of ‘heaven’s own colour.’
Thackeray damaged this tradition by invariably making his dark
heroines nice, his fair heroines treacherous sirens.” Byron, we
may add, also showed a passionate preference for brunettes; and
does not another great love-poet, Moore, speak of “eyes of unholy
blue”?</p>

<p class='c001'>Speaking of the Germans, the anthropologist Waitz remarks
that “the blond and red hair, the blue eyes and light complexion,
which most of them had at the period of the Roman wars, have
not disappeared, it is true, but certainly diminished greatly in
frequency. In Jarrold we find the analogous statement that as
late as the time of Henry VIII. red hair predominated in England,
and that at the beginning of the fifteenth century gray eyes were
more common, dark eyes and dark hair less common, than now.”
As this change is correlated in both these countries with a gradual
refinement of the features, does it not indicate that modern
æsthetico-amorous selection favours the brunette type?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>Waitz’s assertion regarding the gradual decrease in the number
of blondes in Germany is strikingly confirmed by the results of a
series of statistical investigations undertaken under the supervision
of Professor Virchow. Almost eleven million school children were
examined in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Belgium, and the
results showed that Switzerland has only 11·10, Austria 19·79,
and Germany 31·80 per cent of pure blondes. Thus the very
country which, since the days of ancient Rome has been proverbially
known as the home of yellow hair and blue eyes, has to-day
only 32 pure blondes in a hundred; while the average of pure
brunettes is already 14·05 per cent (and in some regions as high as
25 per cent). The 53·15 per cent of the mixed type are evidently
being slowly transformed into pure brunettes, thanks to intermarriages
with the neighbours who are of the dark variety east and
west, as well as south of Germany.</p>

<p class='c001'>In England Dr. Beddoe has collected a number of statistics
which also bear out the theory that brunettes are gaining on
blondes. Among 726 women examined he found 369 brunettes
and 357 blondes. Of the brunettes he found that 78·5 per cent
were married, while of the blondes only 68 per cent were married.
Thus it would seem that a brunette has ten chances of getting
married in England to a blonde’s nine. Hence Dr. Beddoe reasons
that the English are becoming darker because the men persist in
selecting the darker-haired women as wives.</p>

<p class='c001'>In France a similar view has been put forth by M. Adolphe de
Candolle in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Archives des Sciences</cite></span>. He found that when both
parents have eyes of the same colour 88·4 per cent inherit this
colour. "But the curious fact comes out that more females than
males have black or brown eyes, in the proportion, say, of 49 to 45
or of 41 to 39. Next, it appears that with different coloured
eyes in the two parents, 53·09 per cent of the progeny followed
the fathers in being dark-eyed, and 55·09 per cent followed their
mothers in being dark-eyed. An increase of 5 per cent of dark-eyed
in each generation of discolorous unions must tell heavily in
the course of time. It would seem," adds <cite>Science</cite>, to which I owe
this summary of De Candolle’s views, “that, unless specially bred
by concolorous marriages, blue-eyed belles will be scarce in the
millennium.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>WHY CUPID FAVOURS BRUNETTES</h3>

<p class='c013'>How are we to account for this undeniable change in favour of
brunettes? Is it merely a matter of Taste and Fashion? Are we
simply going through a period of brunette-worship which in turn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>will be followed by a century or two of blonde-worship, and so on
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad infinitum</i></span>? or are there reasons for believing that Cupid will
abide by his present decision, and continue to eliminate blondes?
There are several such reasons, which may best be discussed separately,
under the heads of Complexion, Hair, and Eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) <em>Complexion.</em>—The dark skin is more soft and velvety than
the light skin, and therefore more agreeable to the touch; hence,
as Winckelmann remarks, “he who prefers dark to fair beauty is
not on that account to be censured; indeed, one might approve his
choice, if he is attracted less by sight than by the touch.” But
the eye, too, is likely to be more pleased by a brunette than a pure
blond complexion. In the dark skin the pigmentary matter tones
down the too vivid red of the translucent blood, wherefore the
brunette complexion appears more mellow and delicate in its tints
than the Scandinavian blonde, in which a blush suggests a hectic
flush, and its normal whiteness the pallor of ill-health or a lack of
invigorating and beautifying sunshine.</p>

<p class='c001'>The brunette complexion, in a word, suggests to the mind the
idea of <em>stored-up sunshine</em>, i.e. <em>Health</em>; and as Health is what
primarily attracts Cupid, this, combined with his taste for delicate
tints and veiled blushes, partly accounts for his preference of the
dark type. Youthful freshness is another bait which tempts
Cupid; and it is well known that the dark complexion does not,
as a rule, fade so soon as the blond.</p>

<p class='c001'>That the brownish skin is commonly healthier than the white
is also shown by its being less subject to the irregularity in the
secretion of pigmentary matter which causes freckles. These
blemishes, like smallpox marks, are much rarer among the dark
than among blond races and individuals.</p>

<p class='c001'>The skin of blondes who are exposed to a hot sun and raw
weather becomes red, inflamed, and decidedly unbeautiful, while a
brunette’s complexion only becomes a shade darker, and possibly
all the more attractive. This suggests another reason why the
brunettes have an advantage over blondes in the country, where
love-making is chiefly carried on in summer. Yet it will not do
for the blondes to avoid the sunshine on this account, for that will
make them anæmic and prematurely old.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a class of extreme blondes to whom sunlight is not
only irritating, but positively painful. They are called albinos,
because there is no brown pigment whatever in any part of their
body—skin, hair, or iris. The Dutch call them Kakerlaken or
cockroaches, because, like these animals, they avoid the light.
Such anomalous individuals occur also among animals; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>Darwin has noted regarding birds that albinos do not pair,
apparently because they are rejected by their normally-coloured
comrades. This fact has a remote bearing on our argument, for
blondes are intermediate between albinos and brunettes.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would appear, indeed, as if not only the complexion but the
general constitution of the dark type were superior to that of the
blond type. In the chapter on the Complexion it was stated that
a dark hue is regarded in Australia and elsewhere as evidence of
superior strength. The ancient Greeks, Winckelmann tells us,
although they called the young with fair complexions “children of
the gods,” looked upon a brown complexion in boys as an indication
of courage. Professor Topinard states that “the fair races
are especially adapted to temperate and cool regions, and the
South is looked upon as almost forbidden ground. The brown
races, on the contrary, have a remarkable power of becoming
acclimatised.” Several writers have even endeavoured to account
for the gradual increase in the proportion of brunettes by connecting
it with the modern tendency towards centralisation of the
population in large cities, where the blondes, being unable to
resist their unsanitary surroundings, are eliminated, while the
more vigorous and fertile brunettes survive and multiply.</p>

<p class='c001'>One reason why tourists are more impressed by the prevalence
of beauty in southern than in northern regions, is because the
working classes are more beautiful in the South than in the
North; and the working classes, of course, constitute the vast
majority of the population everywhere. “In northern countries,”
says Mr. Lecky, “the prevailing cast of beauty depends rather on
colour than on form. It consists chiefly of a freshness and
delicacy of complexion which severe labour and constant exposure
necessarily destroy, and which is therefore rarely found in the
highest perfection among the very poor. But the southern type
is essentially democratic. The fierce rays of the sun only mellow
and mature its charms. Its most perfect examples may be found in
the hovel as in the palace, and the effects of this diffusion of beauty
may be traced both in the manners and the morals of the people.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Another advantage to the study and development of Personal
Beauty lies in the fact, noted by Ruskin, “that in climates where
the body can be more openly and frequently visited by sun and
weather, the nude both comes to be regarded in a way more
grand and pure, as not of necessity awakening ideas of base kind
(as pre-eminently with the Greeks), and also from that exposure
receives a firmness and sunny elasticity very different from the
silky softness of the clothed nations of the North.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>(2) <em>Hair.</em>—"That noble beauty," says Winckelmann, “which
consists not merely in a soft skin, a brilliant complexion, wanton or
languishing eyes, but in the shape or form, is found more frequently
in countries which enjoy a uniform mildness of climate.” “This
difference shows itself even in the hair of the head and of the
beard, and both in warm climates have a more beautiful growth
even from childhood, so that the greater number of children in
Italy are born with fine curling hair, which loses none of its
beauty with increasing years. All the beards, also, are curly,
ample, and finely shaped; whereas those of the pilgrims who come
to Rome from the other side of the Alps are generally, like the
hair of their heads, stiff, bristly, straight, and pointed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless, the hair is the blonde’s one feature in which, so
far as the head itself is concerned, she may dispute the supremacy
with the brunette. Light hair is finer than dark hair, and there
is more of it to the square inch; and as for the colour, who will
say that a girl with “golden locks which make such wanton
gambols” is inferior in beauty to one who is “robed in the long
night of her deep hair”?</p>

<p class='c001'>But if the positive tests of Beauty—Colour, Lustre, Smoothness,
Delicacy, etc.—do not permit us to give the preference to
dark hair, it is otherwise when we come to the negative tests. A
fine head of blond hair <em>may</em> be as beautiful as a head of brown
hair, but it is not so apt to be beautiful; it has a tendency to
become “stiff, bristly, straight, and pointed.” There are various
reasons for believing that light hair as a rule is not so healthy,
not so well-nourished, as dark hair. Every reader must have
noticed among his friends that the blondes are much more likely
than the brunettes to complain of dry and refractory hairs, and
difficulty in keeping them in shape.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The end of long hair is usually lighter in colour than its
beginning,” as Professor Kollmann remarks: “at a distance from
the skin the hairs lose their natural oil as well as the nourishing
sap which comes from their roots.” This implies that the colour
of the hair becomes darker with increasing vigour and vitality.
We have seen that the same is true of the colour of animals in
general, the healthiest being the most vividly coloured, and the
males commonly darker than the less vigorous females; and as
for plants, who has not noticed how easy it is to trace the course
of an invisible brooklet in a meadow, not only by the greater
luxuriance, but the much darker colour of the grass which lines its
banks?</p>

<p class='c001'>Once more, we know that old age, great sorrow, terror, headaches,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>or insanity, diminish the pigmentary matter in the hair and
make it lighter—gray or white; and that by frequently brushing
blond hair we not only make it more glossy and shapely, but at
the same time darker.</p>

<p class='c001'>Red hair is probably an abnormal variety of blond hair, since
it does not occur among the darker races. It is disliked not only
because it is so often associated with freckles, but because it is
commonly dry, coarse, and bristly. The Brahmins were forbidden
to marry a red-haired woman; and the populace of most countries,
confounding moral with æsthetic impressions, accuses red-haired
people of various shortcomings. “Sandy hair, when well brushed
and kept glossy with the natural oil of the scalp, changes to a
warm golden tinge. I have seen,” says the author of the <cite>Ugly
Girl Papers</cite>, “a most obnoxious head of colour so changed by a
few years’ care that it became the admiration of the owner’s
friends, and could hardly be recognised as the withered, fiery locks
once worn.”</p>

<p class='c001'>An American newspaper paragraph, for the truthfulness of
which I cannot vouch, recently stated that twenty-one men in
Cincinnati, who had married red-haired women, were found to be
colour-blind. A person who is colour-blind mistakes red for
black.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <em>Eyes.</em>—But it is when we leave the scalp that the
superiority of dark over light hair becomes most manifest. That
black eyelashes and eyebrows are infinitely more beautiful than
light-coloured ones, is admitted without a dissentient voice; and
it is needless to add that brunettes, whether gray or black-eyed,
are almost certain to have dark eyelashes, while blondes are
almost certain not to have them. Hence the painting of light
eyelashes has been a common artifice among all nations and at
all times; and Mrs. Haweis goes so far as to sanction the use of
nasty gray hair powder because it “makes the eyebrows and eyelashes
appear much darker than they really are.” I have, however,
seen black eyelashes on several young ladies who could
hardly be classed as brunettes, and who assured me on their
conscience that they had not dyed them. Can it be possible that
Sexual Selection (<i>i.e.</i> the æsthetic overtone in Romantic Love) is
endeavouring to evolve a type of Beauty in which golden locks
will be allowed to remain, while the eyelashes will be changed to
black? The only objection to this surmise is that the hair in
other parts of the face (chin and upper lip), though rarely of the
same colour as that on the scalp, is almost always lighter in hue.
But, whether or not Love can accomplish the miracle of making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>black lashes universal, the fact remains that they are in all cases
a thousand times more charming than yellow or red lashes, and
also more apt to be long and delicately curved, coyly veiling the
mysterious lustre and fire of the iris.</p>

<p class='c001'>Concerning the iris, in turn, it cannot be denied that it is most
beautiful when black (dark brown), or so deeply blue or violet as
to be easily taken for black. This superiority of the dark hue is
due partly to the fact that a brown eye is commonly more lustrous
than a light eye, and partly to the law of contrast; for a light-coloured
iris obviously does not present such a vivid contrast to
the white of the eye as a brown iris, and is therefore apt to seem
vague, watery, and superficial in expression. The light blue or
gray eye appears shallow. All its beauty seems to be on the
surface, whereas the “soul-deep eyes of darkest night” appear
unfathomable through their bewitching glamour.</p>

<p class='c001'>What is the etymology of the word bella donna? Was it
given to the plant on account of the beauty of its cherry-like
berries? or was it not rather chosen by some poet who noted the
wondrous effect of these poisonous berries in changing all eyes
into black eyes by enlarging the pupils, thus making every donna
a bella donna, or “beautiful lady”? Great, indeed, must be the
fascination of a large pupil, since so many women have braved
the danger to health, and the certainty of impairment of vision,
which follow the use of this poison as a cosmetic.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was noted in an earlier part of this volume that young men
are led to propose chiefly in the evening, because the twilight
enlarges the pupil, thus not only beautifying <em>her</em> eyes, but enabling
him to see <em>his own</em> divine image reflected in them, proving his
Monopoly of her soul. A brunette’s dark eyes on such an occasion
appear to be <em>all</em> pupil: how, then, can you wonder that
brunettes are gaining on blondes?</p>

<p class='c001'>However, let not the blondes despair. As they become
scarcer they will for that very reason be valued the more as
curiosities, and the last of them, should she fail to find a husband,
will be able to command a handsome salary in a museum or as a
comic opera singer.</p>

<p class='c001'>Moreover, there is no reason why physiologists should not ere
long discover the secret of changing the tint of the skin, hair, and
iris to suit one’s taste. All children are born with light eyes, but
a great many exchange them for dark eyes as soon as they realise
their mistake. We also know that ill-health temporarily changes
the colour of the hair. According to the <cite>Popular Science Monthly</cite>,
“Prentiss records a case of a patient to whom muriate of pilocarpine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>was administered hypodermically, and whose hair was
changed from light blond to nearly jet black, and his eyes from
light blue to dark blue.” The eating of sorghum is also said to
favour the evolution of a brunette colour. But it is to the electricians
that we must look for a harmless and efficient method of
stimulating the secretion of pigmentary matter in the iris, skin,
and hair. The man who first discovers how to change blondes
to brunettes will acquire a fame as great as Newton’s or Shakspere’s,
and when he dies Cupid will appoint him his private
secretary.</p>

<p class='c001'>“John,” we can hear a woman say to her husband twenty
years hence—"John, Laura is now five years old. Don’t you
think it is time to send her over to Dr. Electrode? I don’t object
to her yellow hair, but I do think her complexion, iris, and
eyelashes should be made several shades darker. She will
then stand a better chance in the marriage-market when she
gets older."</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>NATIONALITY AND BEAUTY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Beauty, like Love, has its national peculiarities, based on
climate, customs, traditions, mental and physical. As the description
of all these differences between the various peoples in
the world would require several volumes the size of this, it
cannot, of course, be attempted here even roughly. Nor is this
necessary, for most of these national peculiarities are variations
which have more ethnologic than æsthetic interest. Many of
them have been considered in the preceding pages to illustrate the
Evolution of Personal Beauty; and something has been said
episodically regarding Greek, Hebrew, Georgian, and Mediæval
Beauty. Polish women are famous for their beauty, but as I have
never been in Poland nor in Russia, I do not feel competent to
pronounce judgment on the common verdict, and will therefore
limit my observations to the six nations whose Love-customs I
have endeavoured to describe. And even in these cases I cannot
claim that the following remarks have any greater value than
such as attaches to mere casual jottings. In most European
countries the nations are as wildly mixed as in the United States,
though less recently; and it is therefore extremely difficult to
draw any general conclusions, as is shown by the conflicting
opinions of tourists. Moreover, each nation is variously subdivided,
so that some things are, <i>e.g.</i> true of North Germany
which are not true of South Germany, and so in other countries.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>Yet there are a few points on which travellers commonly agree,
and these will be briefly considered here. The highest beauty is
pretty much the same the world over—in Japan as in France;
and even among the savages of Africa young girls are to be found
who, but for their colour, would be pronounced beauties in
Europe. Most nations are on their way towards this highest type
of Beauty, and they occupy different stages of evolution according
to their attitude and advantages regarding the four principal
sources of Personal Beauty—Hygienic Habits, Mixture of Nationalities,
Romantic Love, and Mental Refinement.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>FRENCH BEAUTY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Widely as tourists commonly differ in their opinions as to the
prevalence of Beauty in various countries, on one point there
seems to be a universal agreement—viz. that nowhere in Europe
is it so rare as in France. Thackeray notes that nature has
“rather stinted the bodies and limbs of the French nation.”
Walker, in his work on Beauty, remarks that “the women of
France are among the ugliest in the world”; and Sir Lepel Griffin
puts the truth pointedly in these words: <a id='corr506.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='National'>“National</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_506.19'><ins class='correction' title='National'>“National</ins></a></span> vanity, where
inordinately developed, may take the form of asserting that black
is white, as in France, where the average of good looks, among
both men and women, is perhaps lower than elsewhere in Europe.
If a pretty woman be seen in the streets of Paris, she is almost
certainly English or American; yet if a foreigner were to form an
estimate of French beauty from the rapturous descriptions of contemporary
French novels, or from the sketches of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>La Vie
Parisienne</cite></span>, he must conclude that the Frenchwoman was the
purest and loveliest type in the world in face and figure.
The fiction in this case disguises itself in no semblance of the
truth.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet there have been French writers who felt the shortcomings
of their nation in regard to Personal Beauty. One of them says
that you find in the Frenchman “the love of the graceful rather
than the beautiful”; and in the following characterisation of his
countrywomen, by M. Figuier, it is easy to see that he lays
much more emphasis on their grace and the expressiveness of
their features than on their Beauty proper: “There is in her face
much that is most pleasing, although we can assign her physiognomy
to no determinate type. Her features, <em>frequently irregular</em>,
seem to be borrowed from different races; they do not possess
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>that unity which springs from calm and majesty, but are in the
highest degree expressive, and marvellously contrived for conveying
every shade of feeling. In them we see a smile though it be
shaded by tears; a caress though they threaten us; and an
appeal when yet they command. Amid <em>the irregularity of this
physiognomy</em> the soul displays its workings. As a rule the
Frenchwoman is short of stature, but in every proportion of her
form combines grace and delicacy. Her extremities and joints
are fine and elegant, of perfect model and distinct form, without a
suspicion of coarseness. With her, moreover, art is brought
wonderfully to assist nature” (<cite>The Races of Man</cite>).</p>

<p class='c001'>It appears, indeed, as if Frenchwomen, who are naturally
bright and quickwitted, endeavoured to make up in grace what
they lack in beauty. Hence nothing is more common than
Frenchwomen who are so fascinating with their graceful little
ways and movements that one almost or quite forgets their
homeliness. No French girl ever needs to be taught how to use
her eyes to best advantage; and, as a clever newspaper writer has
remarked, French girls “can say more with their shoulders than
most girls can with their eyes; and when they talk with eyes,
hands, shoulders, and tongue at once, it takes a man of talent to
keep up.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Of course it would be absurd to say that no specimens of
supreme Beauty are to be found in France; but they are scarce as
strawberries in December. The general tendency of women to
become either too stout or too lean after they have got out of
their teens, is apparently more pronounced in France than elsewhere
in Europe. And as for the men, they can be recognised
anywhere, either by their almost simian hairiness or their puny
appearance. What a difference in stature and general manly
aspect between a regiment of French and one of English or
German soldiers! And the superiority of the English soldiers
to the French in vigour and beauty is more than “skin-deep”; it
appears to extend to the very chemical composition of their
tissues; for Professor Topinard remarks in his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Anthropologie</cite></span> that
he enunciated more than twenty years ago “a fact which was
more or less confirmed by others, namely, that the mortality
after capital operations in English hospitals was less by one-half
than in the French. We attributed it to a better diet, to their
better sanitary arrangements, and to their superior management.
There was but one serious objection offered to our statement. M.
Velapeau, with his wonderful acumen, made reply, at the Academy
of Medicine, that the flesh of the English and of the French
<span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>differed; in other words, that the reaction after operations was
not the same in both races. It is, in effect, an anthropological
character.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus the “wonderful acumen” of two French scientists has
established the fact that French deterioration is shown not only in
a surprisingly low birth-rate, but in the general inferiority of the
French constitution: for the ability to resist the effects of wounds
or illness is evidence of a sound constitution.</p>

<p class='c001'>That the chief cause of French ugliness, degeneration, and infertility
lies in their contemptuous treatment of Romantic Love,
must be apparent to any one after reading the preceding chapter
on French Love. French parents may point triumphantly to cases
of genuine Conjugal attachment in their sons and daughters, whose
marriages were based on social or pecuniary considerations. But
they forget the <em>grandchildren</em>. It is they who suffer from these
ill-assorted, fortuitous unions. Only the children of Love are
beautiful and destined to multiply.</p>

<p class='c001'>French indifference to the claims of Love also explains why
another leading source of Beauty—the mixture of races—is inoperative
in their country. The French are a very mixed nation.
In the North, says Dr. Topinard, “we find the descendants of the
Belgæ, the Walloons, and other Kymri; in the East, those of
Germans and Burgundians; in the West, Normans; in the centre,
Celts, who at the same epoch at which their name took its origin
consisted of foreigners of various origins and of the aborigines; in
the South, ancient Aquitanians and Basques; without mentioning
a host of settlers like the Saracens, who are found here and there,
Tectosages, who have left at Toulouse the custom of cranial deformities,
and the traders who passed through the Phocæan town
of Marseilles.” But the advantages which might result to Personal
Beauty from such a mixture of peoples are neutralised through the
universality of money-marriages, notwithstanding that these must
in some cases bring together the descendants of different races.
For a mixture of races is not necessarily and always an advantage,
but only when it enables a lover to profit by the greater physiognomic
variety in finding a mate whose qualities will blend harmoniously
with his own.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the case of a third primal source of Beauty—Mental Culture—we
find again that its action is impeded through the anomalous
position of Love in France. Inasmuch as adulterous love-making
is the only kind of Love-making sanctioned by French custom and
described in French literature, it is necessary to withhold most
books and periodicals from the young of both sexes, who are thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>compelled to grow up in ignorance. “The burden of ignorance
presses sorely upon her,” says M. Figuier of the Frenchwoman:
“It is a rare thing for a woman of the people to read, as only
those of the higher classes have leisure, during their girlhood, to
cultivate their minds. And yet even they must not give themselves
up too much to study, nor aspire to honour or distinction.
The epithet <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bas bleu</i></span> (‘blue-stocking’) would soon bring them
back to the common crowd—<em>an ignorant and frivolous feminine
mass</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Note that this is the confession of a patriotic Frenchman.
The fact that there have been a few brilliant Frenchwomen,
famous for their <em>salons</em>, has created the impression that most
Frenchwomen are brilliant, whereas the majority appear to be
utterly without intellectual interests or ambition. Nor could this
possibly be otherwise, considering the extremely superficial education
which even the most favoured receive in the nuns’ schools.
And not a few of them bring home from these schools something
worse than ignorance, viz. the constitution and habits of an invalid.
Not only the girls, even the boys in French schools are never
allowed to play without supervision. Healthy romping is considered
undignified in young girls, and when they get a little older
the high-heeled, pointed shoes prescribed by Fashion take away
any desire they may feel to indulge in beautifying exercise. Uncomfortable
shoes and clothing, combined with the necessity of
having a chaperon, even to simply cross the street, prevent French
girls from indulging in those long walks to which English girls
owe their fine physique. Nor do the French show such a devotion
to the bath-tub and other details of Personal Hygiene as their
neighbours across the channel.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus we see that the French, thanks to their conservative,
Oriental customs, are placed at a disadvantage as regards every
one of the four main sources of Beauty—Romantic Love, Mixture
of Races, Mental Culture, and Hygiene. And it is not only
Personal Beauty that suffers. A writer in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>La Réforme Sociale</cite></span>
complains that “family feeling is dying out, the moral sense
is growing weaker ... the country is falling into a state of
anæmia.” And another writer in the same periodical, after noting
the alarming fact that although France has gained eight million
inhabitants since 1805, the number of births is no larger than it
was then, calls upon those interested in these symptoms of national
decay to investigate the local causes of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it is needless to look for “local causes.” The disease is
a national one, and calls for constitutional treatment. Let the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>French, in the first place, instead of locking up their girls till
they are ready to be sold to a rich <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>roué</i></span>, initiate them into the
arts of Anglo-American Courtship, and then allow Romantic Love
to take the place of money as a matchmaker. That the effect of
such a change would be miraculous may be inferred from the fact
that the products of a few generations of American love-making—French
girls in Canada and the United States—are vastly superior
in Beauty and Health to their transatlantic cousins.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the second place, the French must give up the notion that
disease is aristocratic. “In almost all countries,” says M. About,
“there exists a class distinguished from the masses as the aristocracy.
In this social miscellany the women have small white
hands, because they wear gloves and do not work; a pale complexion,
because they are never exposed to the sun; a sickly
appearance and thin features, because they spend the four months
of the winter at balls. Hence it follows that ‘distinction’ consists
in a faded complexion, sickly appearance, a pair of white
hands, and thin features. The Madonnas of Raphael are not
‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>distingué</i></span>,’ and the Venus of Milo also is very deficient in that
quality.”</p>

<p class='c001'>After they have ceased to ridicule Love and to worship Disease,
it will be in order for the French to cultivate their æsthetic Taste.
That of all European men Frenchmen show the worst taste in
dressing is commonly admitted; but the preposterous superstition
that French<em>women</em> have a special instinct for dressing tastefully is
so firmly rooted in the mind of women elsewhere, that nothing
short of a miracle would be able to eradicate it. The reason why
the roots of this superstition are so deep is this: Frenchwomen
rarely have any great beauty of figure or features. Hence they
devote all their time to devising means for hiding their formal
defects and distracting the attention of men by some novelty or
eccentricity of apparel. In America and Germany, where the
majority of the women are also ugly, these tricks are eagerly
copied; and the pretty girls are compelled to yield to the tyranny
of the majority, as has been fully explained in the chapter on the
Fashion Fetish.</p>

<p class='c001'>Englishwomen have, to a large extent, emancipated themselves
from Parisian Fashion Tyranny, aided by the protests of the men
against self-inflicted ugliness. And it is one of the healthiest signs
of the times that in America, too, the men are beginning to break
the ice of gallant timidity, and telling the women plainly what
they think of their hideous Parisian fashions. Not long ago an
intelligent woman wrote to the Boston <cite>Transcript</cite>, asking: “Why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>will not the press, instead of growling and snarling at <em>the poor
women who cannot help themselves</em>,” ask the theatre managers to
compel the women to take off their high hats, which, she admits,
ninety-nine in a hundred women consider a nuisance? Yet they
“cannot help themselves!” The poor women! What a terrible
slavery! the pretty women of America <em>compelled</em> to adopt the
fashions originated by the ugliest women of Europe in order to
hide their defects!</p>

<p class='c001'>If American women must have models, let them go to Spain or
Italy for them, especially in the matter of headdresses. Of the
Spanish mantilla, which can be adapted to the style of every face,
Prosper Mérimée says that “it makes ugly women pretty, and
pretty ones enchanting.” And a German lady on her way to
Spain bought on her way, as a matter of course, the latest Parisian
hat. “But when I arrived in Madrid,” she writes, “my genuine
Parisian hat seemed of such apelike ugliness that I felt actually
ashamed to wear it. For my taste had been corrected and improved
at sight of the first mantilla I saw; and I am convinced
that a large majority of German women and girls possess quite as
much sense of beauty as I, and will therefore prefer the Spanish
mantilla to any hat made by the most noted <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>modiste</i></span> in Europe.”</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>ITALIAN BEAUTY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Although differences in form, complexion, and physiognomy are
to be noted in different parts of France, they are less pronounced
than in Italy, concerning which it is therefore more difficult to
make general statements. “The barbarian invasions in the north,
and the contact with Greeks and Africans in the south,” says
M. Figuier, “have wrought much alteration in the primitive type
of the inhabitants of Italy. Except in Rome and the Roman
Campagna, the true type of the primitive Latin population is
hardly to be found. The Grecian type exists in the South, and
upon the eastern slope of the Apennines, while in the North the
great majority of faces are Gallic. In Tuscany and the neighbouring
regions are found the descendants of the ancient Etruscans....
The mixture of African blood has changed the organic type
of the Southern Italian to such an extent as to render him entirely
distinct from his Northern compatriots, the exciting influence which
the climate has over the senses imparting to his whole conduct a
peculiar exuberance.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In their estimate of Italian Beauty tourists differ widely. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>raptures and ecstasies of some writers are explained by others as
due to the æsthetic intoxication produced by sudden contact with
a new type; and they claim that a few years’ residence suffices to
dispel these illusions. On the judgment of the Italians themselves
it is not safe to rely, for that is tinged too much by local patriotism,
the Milanese claiming the pre-eminence in Beauty for themselves,
while the Venetians, Florentines, Romans, and Neapolitans blow
their own horns respectively. Professor Mantegazza thinks that
the men are handsomer in Italy than the women, of whom he
allows only about ten per cent to have any claims to real Beauty.
Sir Charles Bell notes that “Raphael, in painting the head of
Galatea, found no beauty deserving to be his model; he is reported
to have said that there is nothing so rare as perfect beauty in
woman; and that he substituted for nature a certain idea inspired
by his fancy.” Montaigne, who travelled in Italy in the latter
part of the sixteenth century, expressed his surprise at the rarity of
beauty in women and girls, who at that time were kept in more
than French seclusion. A German author, Dr. J. Volkmann,
wrote in 1770 that “there are few beautiful women in Rome,
especially among the higher classes; in Venice and Naples more
are to be seen. The Italian himself has a proverb which says that
Roman women are not beautiful” (quoted by Ploss).</p>

<p class='c001'>Byron, in one of his letters, gives a glowing description of an
Italian beauty of the Oriental type whom he met, and then adds:
“Whether being in love with her has steeled me or not, I do not
know; but I have not seen many other women who seem pretty.
The nobility, in particular, are a sad-looking race—the gentry
rather better.” In another place he writes that “the general race
of women appear to be handsome; but in Italy, as on almost all
the Continent, the highest orders are by no means a well-looking
generation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet was it not Byron who wrote of Italy that it is “the garden
of the world,” and that its “very weeds are beautiful”? And does
not this apply to the race as well as the soil? It is because they
constantly live in a garden, in the balmy air and mellowing sunshine,
that Italians can to a certain extent defy the laws of personal
Hygiene, and flourish under conditions which would torture us to
death. Miss Margaret Collier remarks, in <cite>Our Home by the
Adriatic</cite>, that in the rural communities, even among the well-to-do,
to ask for a bath is to create alarm as to the state of your health.
And Berlioz speaks somewhere of Italian peasant-girls “carrying
heavy copper vessels and faggots on their heads; but all so wretched,
go miserable, so tattered, so filthily dirty, that, <em>in spite of the beauty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>of the race</em> and the picturesqueness of their costume, all other
feelings are swallowed up in one of utter compassion.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Could the cosmetic value of fresh air and sunshine be more
strikingly attested than by the fact that Berlioz could speak of
“the beauty of the race,” notwithstanding the national indifference
to the laws of cleanliness?</p>

<p class='c001'>In regard to Romantic Love as a source of Beauty, the Italians
also occupy a somewhat anomalous position. In the rural districts
French matrimonial methods seem to be largely followed. Miss
Collier mentions a young lady who visited her to receive her
congratulations on her approaching marriage, and who, on being
asked the name of her future husband, replied naïvely, “Oh, I
don’t know; papa has not yet told me that.” The peasantry,
however, are free to choose their own mates, and it is among them
that Italian Beauty is accordingly most prevalent. In the cities
the method of love-making is “operatic,” as we saw in the chapter
on Italian Love; but the main point is that Individual Choice is
not made impossible as in France, and that the Italians worship
Love as a law instead of looking on it with contemptuous cynicism
and ridicule.</p>

<p class='c001'>The way in which the Mixture of Races affects Italian Beauty
affords a fresh illustration of the superiority of the Brunette type.
In Germany, by general consent, Beauty is much more frequent in
the South, where brunettes abound, than in the North, where they
are scarce. Hence we may conclude that the Blonde type is
improved by the intermixture of the Brunette type. But is the
Brunette type of Northern Italy improved to the same degree by
the admixture of Northern Blondes? Not in my judgment.
Venice and Milan and Bologna, it is true, boast many beautiful
women; but has any tourist in writing about these cities ever
expressed much admiration for Italian Blondes? And are not
Naples and Capri, the paradise of Brunettes, commonly regarded
as the region where Italian Beauty is seen at its best? Here it is
chiefly dark races that have intermingled, hence the eyes are sure
to be of a deep brown colour; whereas in Northern Italy the
introduction of blonde blood produces the lighter, less decided tints
of the iris which we do not admire. This disadvantage, it is true,
is also encountered in South Germany, but it is neutralised by the
gain of dark eyebrows, and long black lashes, and the more supple
and rounded limbs of the South.</p>

<p class='c001'>That mental culture adds much to Italian beauty cannot be
said, for Italian women of all classes are noted for their intellectual
indolence. But atonement is largely made for this by their extreme
<span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>emotional susceptibility. Blue skies, rank vegetation, pretty
scenery, and a natural love of music have softened and trained their
feelings; and though the Italian climate does not favour profound
artistic culture it warms the blood and incites the features to give
expression to every passing mood. It is this habit of emotional
expression that has given a unique charm and the power of graceful
modulation to Italian features. As a German artist, Herr Otto
Knille, remarks of the Italians, “They pose unintentionally. Their
features, especially among the lower classes, have been moulded
through mimic expression practised for thousands of years. Gesture-language
has shaped the hands of many into models of anatomic
clearness. They have a complete language of signs and gestures,
which each one understands, as, for instance, in the ballet. Add
to this the innate grace of this race ... and we see that the
Italian artist has an abundance of material for copying, as compared
with which the German artist must admit his extreme poverty.
Whoever has lived in Italy is in a position to appreciate these
advantages.... Think of the neck, the nape, and the bust of
Italian woman, the fine joints and the elastic gait of both men and
women. Nor are we much better endowed as regards the physiognomy.
The German potato-face is not a mere fancy—the mirror
which A. de Neuville has held up to us, though clouded with
prejudice, shows us an image not entirely untrue to life. We
artists know how rarely a head, especially one which lacks the
enchanting charm of youth, can be used as a model for anything
but flat realism. Most German faces, instead of becoming more
clearly chiselled and elaborated with age, appear more spongy,
vague, and unmeaning.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Winklemann’s remarks on Italian Beauty are in the same vein:
“We seldom find in the fairest portions of Italy the features of
the face unfinished, vague, and inexpressive, as is frequently the
case on the other side of the Alps; but they have partly an air of
nobleness, partly of acuteness and intelligence; and the form of
the face is generally large and full, and the parts of it in harmony
with each other. The superiority of conformation is so manifest
that the head of the humblest man among the people might be
introduced in the most dignified historical painting, especially one
in which aged men are to be represented. And among the women
of this class, even in places of the least importance, it would not
be difficult to find a Juno. The lower portion of Italy, which
enjoys a softer climate than any other part of it, brings forth men
of superb and vigorously-designed forms, which appear to have
been made, as it were, for the purposes of sculpture.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>In confirmation of my statement that in Northern as in Southern
Italy it is the Brunette type that chiefly excites the admiration of
the tourist, I may finally cite Heine’s remarks on the women of
Trent. For, although Trent is a town of the Austrian Tyrol, it
yet is practically an Italian community. Had not business called
him southwards, Heine relates in his <cite>Journey from Munich to
Genoa</cite>, he would have felt tempted to remain in this town where
“beautiful girls were moving about in bevies. I do not know,” he
adds, “whether other tourists will approve of the adjective
‘beautiful’ in this case; but I liked the women of Trent exceptionally
well. They were just of the kind I admire—and I do
love these pale, elegiac faces with the large black eyes that gaze at
you so love-sick; I love also the dusky tint of those proud necks
which Ph&oelig;bus already has loved and browned with his kisses; ...
but above all things do I love that graceful gait, that dumb music
of the body, those limbs with their exquisitely rhythmic movements,
luxurious, supple, divinely careless, mortally languid, anon æthereal,
majestic, and always highly poetic. I love such things as I love
poetry itself; and these figures with their melodious movements,
this wondrous concert of femininity which delighted my senses,
found an echo in my heart, and awoke in it sympathetic strains.”</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>SPANISH BEAUTY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In Spain, as in Italy, Germany, France, and the United States,
we find more Personal Beauty in the Southern than in the
Northern regions. This coincidence cannot be accidental, but
attests the great cosmetic value of sunshine and plenty of fresh
air. Perhaps no other portion of the globe has such a paradisiacal
climate as Andalusia, where the inhabitants practically pass all
their time in the open air,—on verandahs and in their cosy little
galleries, and fragrant orange groves, in whose shade they can
spend the hot part of the day, while the nights are cooled by
balmy mountain or sea breezes. To these natural hygienic advantages
add the unusually happy mixture of nationalities, and the
fact that Romantic Love is much less impeded in its sway than in
France or Italy, and we see at a glance to what the young Andalusian
owes the undulating lines and luscious plumpness of her
figure, her ravishing facial beauty, and her graceful gait, or
“melodious movements,” as Heine would say.</p>

<p class='c001'>Surely the goddess of Beauty herself mixed the national colours
that make up the Spanish type. When Spain was added to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>Roman dominion she was, as Mr. E. A. Freeman remarks, “the
only one of the great countries of Europe where the mass of the
people were not of the Aryan stock. The greater part of the land
was still held by the <em>Iberians</em>, as a small part is even now by
their descendants the Basques. But in the central part of the
<a id='corr516.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='peniusula'>peninsula</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_516.6'><ins class='correction' title='peniusula'>peninsula</ins></a></span> <em>Celtic</em> tribes had pressed in, and ... there were some
<em>Ph&oelig;nician</em> colonies in the south, and some <em>Greek</em> colonies on the
east coast. In the time between the first and second Punic Wars,
Hamilcar, Hasdrubal, and Hannibal had won all Spain as far as
the Ebro for <em>Carthage</em>.” Among the other nations which successively
overran the country were the Goths, Vandals, Suevi, and
Moors; to whom must be added large numbers of Jews and
Gypsies, of which latter race Spain still possesses about 50,000.</p>

<p class='c001'>Most of these nations had some favourable physical traits which
Sexual Selection had the opportunity to fix upon and perpetuate;
while sundry incongruities must have been neutralised and obliterated
by the intermingling of races. And another important consideration
is, that this intermingling of nations was effected so
many centuries ago that it is now no longer a heterogeneous
physical mixture, but a true “chemical,” or physiological, fusion,
in which dissonances and incongruities are less likely to occur than
in countries where the mixture is more recent.</p>

<p class='c001'>That the addition of Greek and Roman blood, redolent of
ancient civilisation, to the original Spanish stock was an advantage
is obvious. The Goth brought his manly vigour; the Gypsy his
concentrated essence of Brunetteism; the Arab his oval face,
dusky complexion, the straight line connecting nose and forehead,
the small mouth and white teeth, the dark and glossy hair, the
delicate extremities and gracefully-arched foot, and above all, the
black eyes and long black eyelashes. If Shakspere is right in
saying that there is no author in the world “teaches such beauty
as a woman’s eye,” then Andalusia easily leads the world in
Personal Beauty. The prosiest tourist becomes poetic in describing
the Andalusian’s “black eye that mocks her coal-black veil.”
Large and round are these eyes, like those of Oriental Houris;
long and dense their black lashes, which yet cannot smother the
mysterious fire and sparkle which their iris appears to have
borrowed of the Gypsies. In many cases there is a vague, piquant
indication of the almond-shaped palpebral aperture—one of the
Semitic traits derived from the Ph&oelig;nicians, Jews, and Saracens.
And then, what woman can make such irresistibly fascinating use
of her eyes as the Spanish brunette?</p>

<p class='c001'>M. Figuier thus sums up the physical characteristics of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>Spanish woman: “She is generally brunette, although the blonde
type occurs much more frequently than is usually supposed. The
Spanish woman is almost always small of stature. Who has not
observed the large eyes, veiled by thick lashes, her delicate nose,
and well-formed nostrils? Her form is always undulating and
graceful; her limbs are round and beautifully moulded, and her
extremities of incomparable delicacy. She is a charming mixture
of vigour, languor, and grace.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The appearance of a Spanish woman,” says Bogumil Goltz,
“is the expression of her character. Her fine figure, her majestic
gait, her sonorous voice, her black, flashing eye, the liveliness of
her gesticulations, in a word, her whole external personality indicates
her character.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is to be noted that whereas French Beauty appears to be
visible to French eyes only, and regarding Italian Beauty opinions
differ, all nations unite in singing the praises of “Spain’s dark-glancing
daughters.” To the French and German testimony just
cited may now be added a few Italian, English, and American
witnesses.</p>

<p class='c001'>Signor E. de Amicis, in his interesting work on Spain, says of
the women of Madrid that “they are still the same little women
so besung for their great eyes, small hands, and tiny feet, with
their very black hair, but skin rather white than dark, so well-formed,
erect, lithe, and vivacious.” But, like all other tourists,
he reserves most of his remarks on Spanish women for his chapters
on Andalusia, although this is the part of Spain which also offers
the richest material for description in its architecture and scenery.
Concerning the women and girls of Seville, as seen in the large
tobacco factory which employs 5000 females, he says: “There
are some very beautiful faces, and even those that are not absolutely
beautiful, have something about them which attracts the
eye and remains impressed upon the memory—the colouring, eyes,
brows, and smile, for instance. Many, especially the so-called
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>gitane</i></span>, are dark brown, like mulattoes, and have protruding lips:
others have such large eyes that a faithful likeness of them would
seem an exaggeration. The majority are small, well-made, and
all wear a rose, pink, or a bunch of field-flowers among their
braids.... On coming out of the factory, you seem to see on
every side for a time, black pupils which look at you with a
thousand different expressions of curiosity, ennui, sympathy, sadness,
and drowsiness.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The same writer found that “The feminine type of Cadiz was
not less attractive than that celebrated one at Seville. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>women are a little taller, a trifle stouter, and rather darker.
Some fine observer has asserted that they are of the Greek type;
but I cannot see where. I saw nothing, with the exception of
their stature, but the Andalusian type; and this sufficed to make
me heave sighs deep enough to have blown along a boat and
obliged me to return as soon as possible to my ship, as a place of
peace and refuge.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. G. P. Lathrop’s description (in <cite>Spanish Vistas</cite>) of the
girls in the Seville factory is pitched in a somewhat lower key
than Signor de Amicis’s: “Some of them,” he writes, “had a
spendthrift, common sort of beauty, which, owing to their southern
vivacity and fine physique, had the air of being more than it really
was.... There were some appalling old crones.... Others,
on the contrary, looked blooming and coquettish. Many were in
startling deshabille, resorted to on account of the intense (July)
heat, and hastened to draw pretty pañuelos of variegated dye over
their bare shoulders when they saw us coming.... The beauty
of these Carmens has certainly been exaggerated. It may be
remarked here that, as an offset to occasional disappointment
arising from such exaggerations, all Spanish women walk with
astonishing gracefulness, and natural and elastic step; and that is
their chief advantage over women of other nations.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A writer in <cite>Macmillan’s Magazine</cite> (1874), after referring to
“the stately upright walk of the Spanish ladies, and the graceful
carriage of the head,” notes that a mother will not allow her
daughter to carry a basket, so as not to destroy her “queenly
walk”; and “her dull eye too will grow moist with a tear, and
her worn face will kindle with absolute softness and sweetness,
if an English señor expresses his admiration of her child’s magnificent
hair or flashing black eyes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The description given by the same writer of a scene he witnessed
along the Guadalquiver, suggests one reason of the healthy
physique and vitality of Spanish women: “An old mill-house,
with its clumsy wheel and a couple of pomegranates, shaded one
corner of this part of the river; and under their shade, sitting up
to their shoulders in the water, on the huge round boulders of
which the bottom of the river is composed, were groups of
Spanish ladies. Truly it was a pretty sight! They sat as though
on chairs, clothed to the neck in bathing-gowns of the gaudiest
colours—red, gray, yellow, and blue; and, holding in one hand
their umbrellas, and with the other fanning themselves, they
formed a most picturesque group.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Washington Irving, in a private letter, paints this picture of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>Spanish beauty whom he saw on a coast steamer: “A young
married lady, of about four or five and twenty, middle-sized,
finely-modelled, a Grecian outline of face, a complexion sallow yet
healthful, raven black hair, eyes dark, large, and beaming, softened
by long eyelashes, lips full and rosy red, yet finely chiselled, and
teeth of dazzling whiteness. Her hand ... is small, exquisitely
formed, with taper fingers, and blue veins. I never saw a female
hand more exquisite.” The husband of this young lady, noticing
that Mr. Irving was apparently sketching her, questioned him on
the matter. Mr. Irving read his sketch to the man, who was
greatly pleased with it; and this led to a delightful though brief
acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c001'>in another letter, Washington Irving writes to a friend:
“There are beautiful women in Seville as ... there are in all
other great cities; but do not, my worthy and inquiring friend,
expect a perfect beauty to be staring you in the face at every turn,
or you will be awfully disappointed. Andalusia, generally speaking,
derives its renown for the beauty of its women and the beauty
of its landscape, from the rare and captivating charms of individuals.
The generality of its female faces are as sunburnt and void of
bloom and freshness as its plains. I am convinced, the great
fascination of Spanish women arises from their natural talent, their
fire and soul, which beam through their dark and flashing eyes,
and kindle up their whole countenance in the course of an interesting
conversation. As I have had but few opportunities of judging
them in this way, I can only criticise them with the eye of a
sauntering observer. It is like judging of a fountain when it is
not in play, or a fire when it lies dormant and neither flames nor
sparkles.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Byron, in <cite>Childe Harold</cite>, waxes enthusiastic over the Spanish
woman’s “fairy form, with more than female grace”—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Her glance how wildly beautiful! how much</div>
      <div class='line'>Hath Ph&oelig;bus wooed in vain to spoil her cheek,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which glows yet smoother from his amorous clutch!</div>
      <div class='line'>Who round the North for paler dames would seek?</div>
      <div class='line'>How poor their forms appear! how languid, wan, and weak!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But in a letter from Cadiz Byron notes the weak as well as the
strong points of Spanish women. “With all national prejudice, I
must confess, the women of Cadiz are as far superior to the English
women in beauty, as the Spaniards are inferior to the English
in every quality that dignifies the name of man.... The Spanish
women are all alike, their education the same.... Certainly they
are fascinating; but their minds have only one idea, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>business of their lives is intrigue.... Long black hair, dark languishing
eyes, clear olive complexions, and forms more graceful in
motion than can be conceived by an Englishman used to the drowsy,
listless air of his countrywomen, added to the most becoming dress,
and, at the same time, the most decent in the world, render a
Spanish beauty irresistible.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Their minds have only one idea,” is an exaggeration, for the
Andalusian women are famed for a considerable amount of innate
wit, rivalling the brightness of their eyes. Yet of deeper intellectual
interests there are none. Of the total population of Spain
only a quarter can read and write; for although schools exist in
abundance, they are very generally neglected; and the estimation
in which teachers are held is seen from the fact that out of 15,000
one half receive an annual salary of less than twenty pounds
sterling.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mental Culture avenges itself bitterly on the women of Spain,
as of other Southern countries, for this neglect of its claims.
While the freshness of youthful Beauty remains, all is well, for
then the sensuous charms are so great that intellectual claims can
be ignored. But when this freshness fades, then it is that the
features begin to show a lack of mental training. Intellectual
apathy masks the face, and gives it an expression of vacuity;
exercise is neglected, and indolence, combined with excessive indulgence
in fattening food, soon destroy the lovely contours of the
figure and the fairy-like gait. “A Spanish woman of forty appears
twice as old,” says Goltz.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus we see that for perfect and permanent Beauty <em>all</em> its
sources must be kept open and utilised.</p>

<p class='c001'>Attention must finally be called to one feature of Andalusian
Beauty which all tourists emphasise, namely, the small stature of
the women, to which they largely owe their exceptional grace of
gait. And there are reasons for believing that the perfected woman
of the millennium will resemble the Andalusian Brunette, not only
in complexion, hair, eyes, gait, and tapering plumpness of figure,
but also in stature. In other words, it seems that Sexual Selection
is evolving the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>petite</i></span> Brunette as the ideal of womanhood.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the ancient Greeks who were not swayed by Romantic
Love, Amazons were greatly admired, as previously noted; and Mr.
Gladstone remarks that “stature was a great element of beauty in
the view of the ancients, for women as well as for men; and their
admiration of tallness, even in women, is hardly restrained by a
limit.”</p>

<p class='c001'>From this Greek predilection modern æsthetico-amorous Taste
<span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span>differs, for several weighty reasons. The first is that a very tall
and bulky woman, though she may be stately and majestic, cannot
be very graceful; and Grace, as we know, is as potent a source of
Love as formal Beauty. Again, there is something incongruous
and almost comic in the thought of a very large woman submitting
to Love’s caresses; and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>le ridicule tue</i></span>. Thirdly, great stature is
rarely associated with delicate joints and extremities. But the
principal reason why the modern lover disapproves of Amazonian
women, mental and physical, is because they are quasi-masculine.
Romantic Love tends to differentiate the sexes in stature as in
everything else. True, Mr. Galton, after making observations on
205 married couples, came to the conclusion that “marriage
selection takes little or no account of shortness and tallness. There
are undoubtedly sexual preferences for moderate contrasts in
height; but the marriage choice appears to be guided by so many
and more important considerations that questions of stature exert
no perceptible influence upon it.... Men and women of contrasted
heights, short and tall or tall and short, married just about
as frequently as men and women of similar heights, both tall or
both short; there were 32 cases of one to 27 of the other.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But Mr. Galton’s argument is rather weak. He admits that
“there are undoubtedly sexual preferences for moderate contrast
in height”; and his own figures show 32 to 27 in favour of
mixed-stature marriages, in most of which the women must have
been shorter, owing to the prevalent feminine inferiority in size.
And in course of time the elimination of non-amorous motives of
marriage will assist the law of sexual differentiation in suppressing
Amazons.</p>

<p class='c001'>The modern masculine preference for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>petite</i></span> female stature is,
furthermore, attested by an irrefutable philological argument which
will be found in the following citation from Crabb’s <cite>English
Synonymes</cite>: “<em>Prettiness</em> is always coupled with simplicity; it is
incompatible with that which is large; a tall woman with masculine
features cannot be <em>pretty</em>. <em>Beauty</em> is peculiarly a female
perfection; in the male sex it is rather a defect; a man can
scarcely be <em>beautiful</em> without losing his manly characteristics, boldness
and energy of mind, strength and robustness of limb; but
though a man may not be <em>beautiful</em> or <em>pretty</em>, he may be <em>fine</em> or
<em>handsome</em>.” <a id='corr521.39'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='A woman'>“A woman</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_521.39'><ins class='correction' title='A woman'>“A woman</ins></a></span> is <em>fine</em> who with a striking figure unites
shape and symmetry; a woman is <em>handsome</em> who has good features,
and <em>pretty</em> if with symmetry of feature be united delicacy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Burke believed that it is possible to fall in love with a very
small person, but not with a giant. There is, indeed, a natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_522'>522</span>prejudice in the modern mind against very tall statue even in men.
Thus, we read in Fuller’s <cite>Andronicus</cite>: “Often the cockloft is
empty in those whom Nature hath built many stories high”; and
Bacon is reported to have said that <a id='corr522.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Nature'>“Nature</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_522.3'><ins class='correction' title='Nature'>“Nature</ins></a></span> did never put her
precious jewels into a garret four stories high, and therefore that
exceeding tall men had ever very empty heads.” An apparent
scientific confirmation of this belief is found in Professor Hermann’s
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Nervensystem</cite></span> (ii. 195), where we read that “when the body
becomes abnormally large, the brain begins to decrease again,
relatively, as Langer found in measuring giant skeletons.” And,
another sign of regression is found in the fact that tall men are apt
to have relatively too have jaws.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>GERMAN AND AUSTRIAN BEAUTY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Although the Germans of to-day are by no means a pure and
distinct race, they are less thoroughly and variously mixed than
most other European nations; and this is one of the main reasons
why Personal Beauty is comparatively rare in the Fatherland. It
is rarest in the northern and central regions, where the original
Blonde type is best preserved, and becomes more frequent the
nearer we approach the Brunette neighbours of Germany—Italy,
Austria-Hungary, and Poland—whose women have been aptly
called “the Spaniards of the north.” France forms an exception.
There, thanks to the imprisonment of Cupid, ugliness is so rampant
that intermarriage only intensifies the natural homeliness,—a fact
of which any one may convince himself by spending a few days in
the borderland between France and Germany.</p>

<p class='c001'>Partly owing to this lack of variety in the national composition
of the Germans, partly to the custom of chaperonage, Romantic
Love has not as wide a scope of selective action as elsewhere; and as
if these impediments to the increase of Beauty were not sufficient,
they are augmented in a wholesale fashion by the parental illusion
that the Love-instinct is a less trustworthy guide to a happy
marriage than “Reason,” <i>i.e.</i> the consideration that the bride has
a few thousand marks and belongs to the same social clique as the
bridegroom. Like their French neighbours, the Germans in these
cases forget the claims of the <em>grandchildren</em> to Health and Beauty—<i>i.e.</i>
the harmonious fusion of the complementary parental qualities
by which Love is inspired.</p>

<p class='c001'>But in regard to the third source of Beauty—Mental Culture—the
Germans surely are pre-eminent among nations, it will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_523'>523</span>claimed. In one sense, no doubt, they are. Almost all Germans
can read and write, and no race equals them in special erudition.
But erudition is not culture. The German system of education is
exceedingly defective, because it cultivates too largely the lowest
of the mental faculties—the Memory. The number of scientific,
historic, and philological facts a German schoolboy knows by heart
is simply astounding; but he has not digested them, and cannot
apply them practically. No attempt is made to cultivate his
higher faculties—his imagination, originality, or the gift of expressing
a thought in elegant language. Were a candidate to show
the wit and brilliancy of a Heine or a Shakspere, it would not add
one grain to the weight his pedantic professors attach to his work.
They will not favour the growth of qualities in which they themselves
are so conspicuously deficient. Note, for example, the vast
contempt with which the pedants of the University of Berlin look
down on “the German Darwin,” Professor Haeckel, because he
dares not only to be original, but to write his books in a language
clear as crystal, and adorned with wit, satire, and literary polish.</p>

<p class='c001'>Other nations are proud of their great men <em>even before they are
dead</em>; not so the Germans. Nor are the Germans really a literary
nation, as a whole. Many books are written there, but they rarely
come under the head of <em>literature</em>; and their circulation, on the
average, is not one-tenth that of English, French, and American
books. Beer is more popular than books.</p>

<p class='c001'>No, the pedantic erudition, which alone is officially honoured
in Germany, is not synonymous with Mental Culture. It does
not vivify the features sufficiently to mould them into plastic shape.
Hence the prevalence of the “spongy features” and Teutonic
“potato-faces” referred to by a German artist quoted in the chapter
on Italian Beauty. “The true national character of the Germans
is clumsiness,” says Schopenhauer; and again: “The Germans are
distinguished from all other nations by the slovenliness of their
style, as of their dress.” And the Swiss Professor, H. F. Amiel,
remarks in his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Journal Intime</cite></span> that “the notion of ‘bad taste’
seems to have no place in German æsthetics. Their elegance has
no grace in it; they cannot understand the enormous difference there
is between distinction (which is <em>gentlemanly</em>, <em>ladylike</em>) and their
stiff <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Vornehmheit</i></span>. Their imagination lacks style, training, education,
and knowledge of the world; it has an ill-bred air even in its
Sunday dress. The race is poetical and intelligent, but common
and ill-mannered.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It must be admitted, however, that the Germans have made
great progress in external refinement and manners since their late
<span class='pageno' id='Page_524'>524</span>war with France, one of the greatest advantages of which to
them was that it destroyed the mystic halo which had for many
generations surrounded the important Parisian Fashion Fetish.
What the Germans need now is a period of Anglomania. They
have already ceased to laugh at the Englishman for travelling with
his bath-tub, and have found it worth while to provide him with
that commodity in the hotels. In course of time bath-tubs in private
German houses may be expected to become more common
than they are now; and after a generation or two shall have given
proper attention to skin-hygiene, freckles and other cutaneous
blemishes will be less prevalent than at present. In their houses
the Germans are really as tidy as any nation; but their indifference
to the appearance of their collars and cuffs often leads one to
suspect the contrary.</p>

<p class='c001'>The next thing the Germans ought to learn of the English is
greater gallantry toward the women, who are too apt to be looked
upon as household drudges, whom it is not necessary to educate or
amuse. Especially ruinous to female Beauty is the hard field
labour required of the women who have the misfortune to belong
to a nation which has not yet outgrown its condition of mediæval
militarism. A German physician, quoted by Dr. Ploss, notes the
fact that the beauty and bloom of youth last but a short time with
the working classes of North Germany: “The hard labour performed
before the body is fully developed too easily destroys the
plumpness, which is an essential element of beauty, draws furrows
in the face, and makes the figure stiff and angular. Often have I
taken a mother who showed me her child for its grandmother.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The author of <cite>German Home Life</cite> remarks in a similar vein:
“German girls are often charmingly pretty, with dazzling complexions,
abundant beautiful hair, and clear lovely eyes; but the
splendid matron, the sound, healthy, well-developed woman, who
has lost no grain of beauty, and yet gained a certain magnificent
maturity such as we in England see daily with daughters who
might well be her youngest sisters—of such women the Fatherland
has few specimens to show. The ‘pale unripened beauties of the
North’ do not ripen, they fade.” And no wonder, for either the
girls belong to the poorer classes and lose their beauty prematurely
from overwork; or, if they are of the well-to-do classes, they get
no Beauty-preserving exercise at all. “German girls,” the
Countess Von Bothmer continues, “have no outdoor amusements,
if we except skating when the winter proves favourable. Boating,
riding, archery, swimming, croquet—all the active, healthy outdoor
life which English maidens are allowed to share and to enjoy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span>with their brothers is unknown to them.... Such diversions are
looked upon by the girls themselves as bold, coarse, and unfeminine....
It is in vain that you tell them such exercises, far from unsexing
them, fit them all the better for the duties of their sex; it
is difficult for them to hear you out and not show the scorn they
entertain for you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>German men, as a rule, are much handsomer than their sisters,
and they owe this superiority partly to the fact that their minds
are not so vacant, and partly to the prolonged physical training
which is the one redeeming feature of their military system.
Nevertheless, especially in South Germany, the men too often lose
their fine manly proportions in an enormous <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>embonpoint</i></span>, the
penalty of drinking too much beer. Nor is the acquisition of a
turnip shape the only bad result of the German habit of spending
every evening in a tavern. The air in these beer-houses is so filthy,
so soaked with vile tobacco smoke and nicotine, that after sitting
in it for an hour the odour haunts one’s clothes for a week, and
poisons the lungs for a month. It is this foul atmosphere, combined
with the stupefying effect of the beer, that accounts for
German heaviness and clumsiness in appearance, attitude, gait, and
literary style.</p>

<p class='c001'>These disadvantages might be to some extent neutralised if, on
returning to his bedroom, the German would spend the rest of the
night, at least, in fresh air. But no! He dreads the balmy night
air as he would a dragon’s breath, although Professor Reclam and
other great authorities on Hygiene have told him a million and
sixty times that night air is more salubrious than day air, except
in swampy regions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tourists in Switzerland often wonder why it is that the natives,
notwithstanding their glorious Alpine air, are, with rare exceptions,
so utterly devoid of Beauty. Partly this is due to the hard labour
and scanty food to which most of them are condemned; but the
main reason is that they enjoy their health-laden air only in the
daytime and in summer. At night and in winter they close their
windows hermetically, and in the morning the atmosphere in such
a room is something which no one who has ever breathed it will
ever forget.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the Germans visit Switzerland they carefully imitate the
example of these ignorant peasants, thus depriving themselves of
all the benefits of an Alpine tour. An eye-witness last summer
told me of the following encounter in a Swiss hotel between an
English lady and a German. The dining-room being hot to suffocation,
the English lady opened a window, whereupon the German
<span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>immediately got up and closed it. The English lady opened it
again, and again it was closed; whereupon she pushed her elbow
through the glass, and thenceforth enjoyed the fresh, fragrant air,
to the horror and indignation of the assembled Teutons.</p>

<p class='c001'>All these remarks of course apply to the Germans only in a very
general way. Among all classes in Germany specimens of Beauty
may be found that could hardly be surpassed anywhere else.
Pretty faces are more frequent than elegant figures, which commonly
are too robust and masculine. German girls are the most
domestic and amiable in the world, and it is their amiability and
depth of feeling that gives their mouth such a sweet expression
and refined outlines. When German girls are educated, as often
they are in America, their faces beam in irresistible beauty. The
most beautiful non-Spanish eyes I have ever seen belonged to a
girl in Baden; and the most roguish blue eyes I have ever seen,
to a Würtemberg girl. Regular Italian features are not uncommon
in Bavaria, although snub-noses are most frequent there. The
Bavarian complexion, though somewhat too pale, is beautifully
clear; and I have almost come to the conclusion that this is in some
way connected with the national habit of drinking beer three times
a day. It might be worth while to inquire whether there is a
beautifying ingredient in beer which might be obtained without its
stupefying effects.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Germans commonly consider the maidens along the Rhine
their most favourable and abundant specimens of Beauty; but
Robert Schumann, who had a fine eye for feminine Beauty, emphasized
the amiability rather than the beauty of these maidens in
the following passage from one of his private letters: “What
characteristic faces among the lowest classes! On the west shore
of the Rhine the girls have very delicate features, indicating
amiability rather than intelligence; the noses are mostly Greek,
the face very oval and artistically symmetrical, the hair brown. I
did not see a single blonde. The complexion is soft, delicate, with
more white than red; melancholy rather than sanguine. The
Frankfort girls, on the other hand, have in common a sisterly trait—the
character of German, manly, sad earnestness which we often
find in our quondam free cities, and which toward the east
gradually merges into a gentle softness. Characteristic are the
faces of all the Frankfort girls: intellectual or beautiful few of
them; the noses mostly Greek, often snub-noses; the dialect I did
not like.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Concerning the peasant women of Saxony, Mr. Julian Hawthorne
remarks in his <cite>Saxon Studies</cite>: “Massive are their legs as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_527'>527</span>banyan root; their hips are as the bows of a three-decker. Backs
have they like derricks: rough hands like pile-drivers.” And
again: “Handsome and pretty women are certainly no rarity in
Saxony, although few of them can lay claim to an unadulterated
Saxon pedigree.” “We see lovely Austrians, and fascinating Poles
and Russians, who delicately smoke cigars in the concert gardens.
But it is hard for the peasant type to rise higher than comeliness;
and it is distressingly apt to be coarse of feature as well as of
hand, clumsy of ankle, and more or less wedded to grease and dirt.
Good blood shows in the profile; and these young girls, whose
faces are often pleasant and even attractive, have seldom an
eloquent contour of nose and mouth. There is sometimes great
softness and sweetness of eye, a clear complexion, a pretty roundness
of chin and throat. Indeed, I have found scattered through
half a dozen different villages all the features of the true Gretchen;
and once, in an obscure hamlet whose name I have forgotten, I
came unexpectedly upon what seemed a near approach to the
mythic being.”</p>

<p class='c001'>One thing must be admitted. The Germans are the most
systematic and persevering nation in the world. They took music,
for instance, from her Italian cradle, and reared her till she
developed into the most fascinating of the modern muses. They
lead the world in scientific research; and within a few years they
have terrified the English monopolists by a sudden outburst of
thorough-going Teutonic industrial activity and world-competition.
Let but the Germans once make up their mind that they want
Personal Beauty, and lo! they will have it in superabundance.
The Professorships of Hygiene, which are now being established at
the Universities, will doubtless bear rich fruit. If Bismarck discovered
the full significance of Anglo-American Courtship, he would
forthwith order an hour of it to be added to the daily academic
curriculum; and if he realised the importance of racial mixture, he
would order shiploads of South American and Andalusian brunettes
to be distributed among his officers as wives. Nor would female
education be any longer neglected, were it fully understood how
essential it is to Personal Beauty and true Romantic Love, the
basis of happy conjugal life.</p>

<p class='c001'>What <em>can</em> be done with German stock if it is duly mixed with
Brunette ingredients, is shown at Vienna, which, by the apparently
unanimous consent of tourists, boasts more beautiful women than
any other city in the world. Austria has about ten per cent more
of the pure Brunette and fourteen per cent more of the mixed types
than Germany. The dark blood of Italians, Hungarians, Czechs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>flows in Viennese veins, and there is also a piquant suspicion of
Oriental beauty. The Viennese woman combines Andalusian
plumpness of figure and grace of movement, with American delicacy
of features and purity of complexion. The bust is almost always
finely developed and rarely too luxuriant; and the joints are the
admiration of all tourists and natives. Speaking of England, Mr.
Richard Grant White says that “Plump arms are not uncommon,
but really fine arms are rare; and fine wrists are still rarer. Such
wrists as the Viennese women have ... are almost unknown
among women of English race in either country.” And the Countess
von Bothmer thus describes the neighbours of Germany:—</p>

<p class='c001'>"Polish, Hungarian, and Austrian women, whom we, in a
general, inconclusive way, are apt to class as Germans, are ‘beautiful
exceedingly’; but here we come upon another race, or rather
such a fusion of other races as may help to contribute to the
charming result. Polish ladies have a special, vivid, delicate,
spirited, haunting loveliness, with grace, distinction, and elegance
in their limbs and features that is all their own; you cannot call
them fragile, but they are of so fine a fibre and so delicate a
colouring that they only just escape that apprehension. Of Polish
and Hungarian <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>pur sang</i></span> there is little to be found; women of
the latter race are of a more robust and substantial build, with
dark hair and complexion, fine flashing eyes, and pronounced type;
and who that remembers the women of Linz and Vienna will refuse
them a first prize? They possess a special beauty of their own, a
beauty which is rare in even the loveliest Englishwomen; rare,
indeed, and exceptional everywhere else; a beauty that the artist
eye appreciates with a feeling of delight. They have the most
delicately articulated joints of any women in the world. The
juncture of the hand and wrist, of foot and ankle, of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>nuque</i></span>
with the back and shoulders, is what our neighbours would call
‘adorable.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“But alas that it should be so! The full gracious figures—types
at once of strength and elegance—the supple, slender waists,
the dainty little wrists and hands, become all too soon hopelessly
fat, from the persistent idleness and luxury of the nerveless,
unoccupied lives of these graceful ladies.”</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>ENGLISH BEAUTY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Like the Viennese, the English afford an illustration of what
can be done with Teutonic stock by a judicious admixture of dark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>blood. Although the mysteries of English ethnology have not
been completely unravelled, the original inhabitants of the British
Islands appear to have been “composed of the long-headed dark
races of the Mediterranean stock, possibly mingled with fragments
of still more ancient races, Mongoliform or Allophylian” (Dr.
Beddoe). In the later history of the race Romans, Germans,
Danes, and Normans added their blood to this mixture. The
Celtic-speaking people who in the time of the Roman Conquest
inhabited South Britain, partook, according to Dr. Beddoe, “more
of the tall blond stock of Northern Europe than of the thickset,
broad-headed, dark stock which Broca has called Celts.” But the
true Blonde invasion of Britain did not occur till towards the beginning
of the fifth century, when the Low-Dutch tribes, the Angles and
Saxons, came over from the river Elbe and the coast region, and
drove the Britons to the west of the island, where they were called
the Welsh, which is an old German appellation for foreigners.</p>

<p class='c001'>The inference naturally suggests itself that the predilection for
Blondes shown in English literature up to a recent date (as noted
in the chapter on Blondes and Brunettes) may be traced to this
fact that the conquering race was fair, and that consequently dark
hair and eyes stigmatised their possessor as belonging to the
conquered race. This condemnation of the Brunette type (on <em>non-æsthetic</em>
grounds, be it noted) is forcibly illustrated by the following
lines of the shepherdess Phebe in <cite>As You Like It</cite>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I have more cause to hate him than to love him;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For what had he to do to chide at me?</div>
      <div class='line'>He said mine eyes were black and my hair black,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And, now I am remember’d, scorned at me.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But when this temporary aristocratic ground of preferring the
Blond type was neutralised through the lapse of time, and
Romantic Love, that potent awakener of the æsthetic sense,
appeared on the scene and opened men’s eyes to the inferior beauty
of that type, then began the reaction in favour of Brunettes, which
has been going on ever since. This view is strikingly confirmed
by the following remarks of Mr. Charles Roberts in <cite>Nature</cite>, January
7, 1885:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“American statistics show that the blonde type is more subject
to all the diseases, except one (chronic rheumatism), which disqualify
men for military service, and this must obviously
place blondes at a great disadvantage in the battle of life,
while the popular saying, ‘A pair of black eyes is the delight of
a pair of blue ones,’ shows that sexual selection does not allow
them to escape from it. It is more than probable, therefore, from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>all these considerations, that the darker portion of our population
is gaining on the blond, and this surmise is borne out by Dr.
Beddoe’s remark that the proportion of English and Scotch blood
in Ireland is probably not less than a third, and that the Gaelic
and Iberian races of the West, mostly dark-haired, are <em>tending to
swamp the blond Teutonic of England by a reflex migration</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Obviously, the ideal Englishwoman of the future will be a
Brunette. Thackeray had a prophetic vision of her when he
described Beatrix Esmond: “She was a brown beauty: that is,
her eyes, hair, and eyebrows and eyelashes were dark; her hair
curling with rich undulations, and waving over her shoulders”
[note that]; “but her complexion was as dazzling white as snow
in sunshine; except her cheeks, which were a bright red, and her
lips, which were of a still deeper crimson ... a woman whose
eyes were fire, whose look was love, whose voice was the sweetest
love-song, whose shape was perfect symmetry, health, decision,
activity, whose foot as it planted itself on the ground was firm but
flexible, and whose motion, whether rapid or slow, was always
perfect grace,—agile as a nymph, lofty as a queen—now melting;
now imperious, now sarcastic—there was no single movement of
hers but was beautiful. As he thinks of her, he who writes feels
young again and remembers a paragon.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Sexual Selection, however, has not limited its efforts to the
improvement of the colour of the hair, eyes, and complexion; the
form of the features and figure has also been gradually altered and
refined. An examination of the portraits in the National Gallery
showed to Mr. Galton “what appear to be indisputable signs of
one predominant type of face supplanting another. For instance,
the features of the men painted by and about the time of Holbein
have unusually high cheek-bones, long upper lips, thin eyebrows,
and lank dark [?] hair. It would be impossible, I think, for the
majority of modern Englishmen so to dress themselves, and clip
and arrange their hair, as to look like the majority of these portraits.”
And again: “If we may believe caricaturists, the fleshiness
and obesity of many English men and women in the earlier
years of this century must have been prodigious. It testifies to
the grosser conditions of life in those days, and makes it improbable
that the types best adapted to prevail then would be the best
adapted to prevail now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet this improvement in the British figure and physiognomy is
far from universal. The English are beyond all dispute the finest
race in the world, physically and mentally; but the favourable
action of the four Sources of Beauty, to which they owe this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_531'>531</span>supremacy, does not extend to all classes. The lowest-class Englishman
or Irishman is the most hideous and brutal ruffian in the
world. Of Mental or Moral Culture not a trace; and whereas
“the Spaniard, however ignorant, has naturally the manners and
the refined feelings of a gentleman” (<cite>Macmillan’s Magazine</cite>, 1874),
as well as a love of the beautiful forms and colours of nature; the
Englishman of the corresponding class has nerves and senses so
coarse that he is absolutely impervious to any impressions which
do not come under the head of mere brutal excitement. In this
class there is no Mixture of Races, but a worse than barbarian
promiscuity; Romantic Love is of course miles beyond the conception
of imaginations so filthy and sluggish; and Hygienic neglect
here finds its most hideous examples in the Western World.</p>

<p class='c001'>In his <cite>English Note-Books</cite> Hawthorne speaks as follows of “a
countless multitude of little girls” taken from the workhouses and
educated at a charity school at Liverpool: “I should not have conceived
it possible that so many children could have been collected
together, without a single trace of beauty or scarcely of intelligence
in so much as one individual; such mean, coarse, vulgar features
and figures betraying unmistakably a low origin, and ignorant and
brutal parents. They did not appear wicked, but only stupid,
animal, and soulless. It must require many generations of better
life to wake the soul in them. All America could not show the
like.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Climate,” he says in another place, “no doubt has most to do
with diffusing a slender elegance over American young women; but
something, perhaps, is also due to the circumstance of classes not
being kept apart there as they are here: they interfuse amid the
continual ups and downs of our social life; and so, in the lowest
stations of life, you may see the refining influence of gentle blood.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Taine, in his <cite>Notes on England</cite>, thus sketches the lowest of
the Englishmen: “Apoplectical and swollen faces, whereof the
scarlet hue turns almost to black, worn-out, bloodshot eyes like raw
lobsters; the brute brutalised. Lessen the quantity of blood and
fat, while retaining the same bone and structure, and increasing the
countrified look; large and wild beard and moustache, tangled hair,
rolling eyes, truculent muzzle, big, knotted hands; this is the
primitive Teuton issuing from his woods; after the portly animal,
after the overfed animal, comes the fierce animal, the English bull.”
“The lower-class women of London,” says another French writer,
Mr. Max O’Rell, “are thin-faced or bloated-looking. They are
horribly pale; there is no colour to be seen except on the tips of
their noses.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>Personal Beauty in England diminishes in quality and frequency,
not only as we go from the upper to the lower classes, but also if
we leave London and go to other cities. How far sanitary and
educational differences account for this state of affairs, and how
much is due to a habitual and natural immigration of Beauty to a
place where it is most sure of appreciation, it is not easy to say.
Hawthorne thus records the impression made on his artistic eyes
by an excursion party of Liverpool manufacturing people: “They
were paler, smaller, less wholesome-looking, and less intelligent,
and, I think, less noisy than so many Yankees would have been....
As to their persons,” the women “generally looked better
developed and healthier than the men; but there was a woeful
lack of beauty and grace,—not a pretty girl among them, all coarse
and vulgar. Their bodies, it seems to me, are apt to be very long
in proportion to their limbs—in truth, this kind of make is rather
characteristic of both sexes in England.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A French writer, quoted by Figuier, Dr. Clavel, makes a similar
statement: “The level plains, which are as a rule met with in
England, are not favourable to the development of the lower extremities,
and it is a fact that the power of the English lies, not so
much in their legs, as in the arms, shoulders, and loins.... The
barely-marked nape of his neck and the oval form of his cranium
indicate that Finn blood flows in his veins; his maxillary power
and the size of his teeth evidence a preference for an animal diet.
He has the high forehead of the thinker, but not the long eyes of
the artist.... In dealing craftily with his antagonist, he is well
able to guard himself against the weaknesses of feeling. His face
rarely betrays his convictions, and his features are devoid of the
mobility which would prove disadvantageous.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Englishwoman, according to the same writer, “is tall, fair,
and strongly built. Her skin is of dazzling freshness; her features
are small and elegantly formed; the oval of her face is marked,
but it is <em>somewhat heavy toward the lower</em> portion; her hair is fine,
silky, and charming; and her <em>long and graceful neck</em> imparts to
the movements of her head a character of grace and pride. So far
all about her is essentially feminine; but upon analysing her bust
and limbs we find that the large bones, peculiar to her race, interfere
with the delicacy of her form, enlarge her extremities, and
lessen the elegance of her postures and the harmony of her movements....
She lacks a thousand feminine instincts, and this lack
is revealed in her toilette, the posture she assumes, and in her
actions and movements.”</p>

<p class='c001'>M. Taine also was convinced of the frequent lack of taste in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>dress and bearing in Englishwomen. Yet it is noticeable, and
cannot be too much emphasised, that he <em>goes to Spain and not to
France</em> for a comparison: “Compared with the supple, easy, silent,
serpentine undulation of the Spanish dress and bearing, the movement
here (in England), is energetic, discordant, jerking, like a
piece of mechanism.” Nor does Taine in other respects venture to
hold up his own countrywomen as models. He repeatedly refers to
the superior beauty of the English complexion: “Many ladies have
their hair decked with diamonds, and their shoulders, much
exposed, have the incomparable whiteness of which I have just
spoken, the petals of a lily, the gloss of satin do not come near to
it.” And though he thinks that ugliness is more ugly in England
than in France, he confesses that “generally an Englishwoman is
more thoroughly beautiful and healthy than a Frenchwoman.”
“Out of every ten young girls one is admirable, and upon five or
six a naturalist painter would look with pleasure.” “Lady Mary
Wortley Montague, who came to see the Court of the Regent in
France, severely rallied our slim, painted, affected beauties, and
proudly held up as a contrast ‘the natural charms and the lively
colours of the unsullied complexions’ of Englishwomen.” “The
physiognomy remains youthful here much later than amongst us,
especially than at Paris, where it withers so quickly; sometimes it
remains open even in old age; I recall at this moment two old
ladies with white hair whose cheeks were smooth and softly rosy;
after an hour’s conversation I discovered that their minds were as
fresh as their complexions. Even when the physiognomy and the
form are commonplace, the whole satisfies the mind; a solid bony
structure, and upon it healthy flesh, constitute what is essential in
a living creature.”</p>

<p class='c001'>That is it precisely. The Englishman is the finest <em>animal</em> in
the world; and it is because other nations so often forget that one
must be a fine animal before one can be a fine man, that the
English have outstripped them in colonising the world, and
imposing on it their special form of culture and manners. As
Emerson remarks, in his Essay on <em>Beauty</em>, “It is the soundness
of the bones that ultimates itself in the peach-bloom complexion;
health of constitution that makes the sparkle and the power of the
eye.” “We are all entitled to beauty, should have been beautiful,
if our ancestors had kept the laws,—as every lily and every rose
is well.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The London <cite>Times</cite> characteristically speaks of “that worst of
sins in English eyes—uncleanliness”; and it is in England alone
of all European countries that cleanliness is esteemed next to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_534'>534</span>godliness. The Frenchman’s paradoxical exclamation, “What a
dirty nation the English must be that they have to bathe so
often!” is not so funny as it seems. The English, as can be seen
in the uneducated classes, <em>would be</em> the dirtiest people in the
world, thanks to their fogs and smoke, if they were not the most
cleanly. It is the magic of tub and towel that has compelled M.
Figuier to admit that although the Englishwomen “do not offer
the noble appearance and luxurious figure of the Greek and Roman
women,” yet “their skins surpass in transparency and brilliancy
those of the female inhabitants of all other European countries.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is needless to dilate on the other hygienic habits to which
the English owe their Health, notwithstanding their often depressing
climate,—the passion for walking and riding, for tennis,
boating, and other sports, which, moreover, have the advantage of
bringing the sexes together, and enabling every Romeo to find his
Juliet. One cannot help admiring the independence and common
sense of the respectable London girls who go home on the top of
the ’bus, enjoying the fresh air and varied sights, instead of being
locked up in the foul-aired interior. They know very well, these
clever girls, that their cheeks will be all the rosier, their smiles
more bewitching, their eyes more sparkling after such a ride. In
countries where there are fewer <em>gentlemen</em> such a thing would be
considered as improper for a girl as it is for a man to give a girl a
chance to choose her own husband. Do the French agree with
the Turks that women have no souls, since, in Taine’s words, a
Frenchman “would consider it indelicate to utter a single clear or
vague phrase to the young girl before having spoken to her
parents”? Taine imparts to his countrymen the curious information
that in England men and women marry for Love, but he does
not appear to realise how much of their superior Beauty—which
he acknowledges—they owe to the habitual privilege of choosing
their own wives for their personal charms, instead of having them
selected by their parents for their money value. He does, however,
realise the effect this system of courtship has on conjugal
life; for in his <em>History of English Literature</em> he refers to the
Englishwoman’s extreme “sweetness, devotion, patience, inextinguishable
affection,—a thing unknown in distant lands, and in
France especially; a woman here gives herself without drawing
back, and places her glory and duty in obedience, forgiveness,
adoration, wishing and pretending only to be melted and absorbed
daily deeper and deeper in him whom she has <em>freely and for ever
chosen</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And there is another English custom the value of which Taine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>realises and acknowledges: “In France we believe too readily,”
he says, “that if a woman ceases to be a doll she ceases to be a
woman.” True, it is only a decade or two since the superstition
that a higher education would “destroy all the feminine graces”
has been successfully combated even in England; but there has
always been a vast amount of home education, and the girls have
profited immensely by the unimpeded opportunity of meeting the
young men and talking with them, and by the fact that the purity
of tone which pervades English literature has made all of it
accessible to them. Hence the charming intellectual lines which
may be traced in an English woman’s face.</p>

<p class='c001'>What the English still need is gastronomic and æsthetic training.
After a few generations of sense-refinement the lower part
of the English face will become as perfect as the upper part is
now. Cultivation of the fine arts and freer facial expression of
the emotions are the two great cosmetics which will put the
finishing touch on English Beauty.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>AMERICAN BEAUTY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>England and America—which of these two countries has the
most beautiful women, and which the largest number of them?
Few questions of international diplomacy have been more frequently
discussed than these problems in comparative æsthetics. But as
in most cases patriotism has taken the place of æsthetic judgment
in forming a verdict, few tangible results have been reached.
There is too much exaggeration. Many English tourists have
denied that there is any remarkable Beauty at all in the United
States, and Americans have said the same of England.</p>

<p class='c001'>If these sceptical Englishmen had only spent an hour on either
side of the New York and Brooklyn Bridge at 6 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, they would
have seen Beauty enough to bewilder all their senses; and if the
American sceptics, next time they go to London, will spend a
shilling in buying penny stamps at a dozen of those small post-offices
so profusely scattered all over the city, they will see enough
feminine Beauty in an hour to make them wish to stay in London
the rest of their life,—especially if they remember that an
advertisement for eleven girls to fill these postal clerkships has
been answered by as many as 2000,—the majority of whom,
presumably, were as good-looking as those who got the places,
since postal clerks are not selected for their Beauty, but for their
intelligence and efficiency.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span>A few specimens of the sweeping generalisations of tourists
may here be cited. According to Richard Grant White, “The
belief, formerly prevalent, that ‘American’ women had in their
youth pretty doll faces, but at no period of life womanly beauty of
figure, is passing away before a knowledge of the truth, and I
have heard it scouted here by Englishmen, who, pointing to the
charming evidence to the contrary before their eyes, have expressed
surprise that the travelling bookwriters ... could have so misrepresented
the truth.” Yet the same author indulges in the
following absurdly extravagant statement: “Beauty is very much
commoner among women of the English race than among those of
any other with which I am acquainted; and among that race it
is commoner in America than in England. I saw more beauty of
face and figure at the first two receptions which I attended after
my return than I had found among the hundreds of thousands of
women whom I had seen in England.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The late Dr. G. M. Beard, though an acute observer, allowed
his patriotism a still more ludicrous sway over his imagination:
“It is not possible,” he says, “to go to an opera in any of our
large cities without seeing more of the representatives of the
highest type of female beauty than can be found in months of
travel in any part of Europe!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Possibly Sir Lepel Griffin had read these lines when he was
moved to pen the following counter-extravagances: “More pretty
faces are to be seen in a day in London than in a month in the
States. The average of beauty is far higher in Canada, and the
American town in which most pretty women are noticeable is
Detroit, on the Canadian border, and containing many Canadian
residents. In the Western States beauty is conspicuous by its
absence, and in the Eastern towns, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New
York, and Boston, it is to be chiefly found. In New York, in
August, I hardly saw a face which could be called pretty....
In November New York presented a different appearance, and
many pretty women were to be seen, although the number was
comparatively small; and at the Metropolitan Opera House even
American friends were unable to point out any lady whom they
could call beautiful. A distinguished artist told me that when
he first visited America he scarcely saw in the streets of New
York a single face which he could select as a model, though he
could find twenty such in the London street in which his studio
was situated.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Volumes might be filled with similar unscientific generalisations,
but it would be a waste of space. My own general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_537'>537</span>impression is that there are more pretty girls In America, and
more beautiful women in England; that the average Englishwoman
has a finer, healthier figure and colour, the American
greater mobility and finer chiselling of the features. If English
hands and feet are often somewhat large, American hands are just
as often too small,—the greater blemish of the two, because it
usually goes with too thin limbs. Irish girls of the best classes
appear to be intermediate. Some of the finest figures and faces
in the world belong to them; an Andalusian could hardly be
more plump and graceful than many Irish and Irish-American
girls. The Scotch, in the opinion of Hawthorne, “are a better-looking
people than the English (and this is true of all classes),
more intelligent of aspect, with more regular features. I looked
for the high cheek-bones, which have been attributed, as a
characteristic feature, to the Scotch, but could not find them.
What most distinguishes them from the English is the regularity
of the nose, which is straight, and sometimes a little curved
inward; whereas the English nose has no law whatever, but
disports itself in all manner of irregularity. I very soon learned
to recognise the Scotch face, and when not too Scotch, it is a
handsome one.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Comparative Æsthetics is still in its infancy, and many years
will doubtless elapse before it will become an exact science, in
place of a collection of individual opinions based on vague impressions.
The statistics which have lately been collected regarding
the proportion of Blondes and Brunettes in various countries,
may be regarded as the beginning of such a science. The next
step should be the collection of a series of national composite
portraits after the manner in which Mr. Galton has formed typical
faces of criminals, etc. If in each country a number of individuals
of pronounced national aspect were photographed on the
same plate, the result would be a picture which would emphasise
the typical national traits, and enable one to judge how far they
deviate in each case from regular Beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'>In most European countries it would be comparatively easy to
obtain characteristic composite portraits of this kind. But in
America the difficulties would perhaps be insurmountable. For
there the mixture of nationalities is too great and too recent to
have produced any national type. The women of Baltimore, New
York, Boston, and San Francisco—what have they in common
with one another any more than with their cousins in London?
Almost one-third of the inhabitants of New York are foreign-born,
including about half a million Irish and Germans. A fusion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_538'>538</span>of these has been going on for generations, while others have retained
their national traits; and to look, therefore, for a special
type of New York Beauty would be absurd. Thanks to this
large number of foreigners—not always of the most desirable
classes—there is less Beauty in New York in proportion to the
number of inhabitants than in most other cities of the United
States. When people imagine they can tell from what American
city a given woman comes, they are hardly ever influenced in
their judgment by physiognomy or figure, but by peculiarities of dress,
speech, or manner.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr. Weir Mitchell says that in America you may see “many
very charming faces, the like of which the world cannot match—figures
somewhat too spare of flesh, and, especially south of
Rhode Island, a marvellous littleness of hand and foot. But look
farther, and especially among New England young girls; you
will be struck with a certain hardness of line in form and feature,
which should not be seen between thirteen and eighteen at least.
And if you have an eye which rejoices in the tints of health,
you will miss them on a multitude of the cheeks which we are now
so daringly criticising.” The notion that there is too much
angularity of outline in New England faces and forms is a wide-spread
one, and to some extent founded on truth; yet many of
the plumpest, rosiest, and most charming American women come
from Boston—as if to make amends for their antipodes, whom
Mr. R. G. White describes as “certain women, too common in
America, who seem to be composed in equal parts of mind and
leather, the elements of body and soul being left out, so far as is
compatible with existence in human form.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Concerning the multitudinous mixture of nationalities in the
United States one thing may be asserted confidently: that the
finest ingredient in it is the English. Yet it has long been held
that the English blood deteriorates in the United States; that the
descendants of the English, like those of the Germans and other
nations and their mixtures, gradually lose the sound constitution
of their ancestors. Hawthorne, in his <cite>Scarlet Letter</cite>, was probably
one of the first to give expression to this belief. Speaking
of the New England women who two centuries ago waited for the
appearance of Hester, he says: “Morally, as well as materially,
there was a coarser fibre in those wives and maidens of old
English birth and breeding than in their fair descendants, separated
from them by a series of six or seven generations; for
throughout that chain of ancestry every successive mother has
transmitted to her child a fainter bloom, a more delicate and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_539'>539</span>briefer beauty, and a slighter physical frame, if not a character of
less force and solidity, than her own.... The bright morning
sun, therefore, shone on broad shoulders and well-developed busts,
and on round and ruddy cheeks, that had ripened in the far-off
island, and had hardly yet grown paler or thinner in the atmosphere
of New <a id='corr539.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='England.'>England.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_539.6'><ins class='correction' title='England.'>England.”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>Yet in his <cite>English Note-Books</cite>, written after the <cite>Scarlet Letter</cite>,
he relates that he had a conversation with Jenny Lind: “She
talked about America, and of our unwholesome modes of life, as
to eating and exercise, and of the ill-health especially of our
women; but I opposed this view as far as I could with any truth,
insinuating my opinion that we were about as healthy as other
people, and affirming for a certainty that we live longer....
This charge of ill-health is almost universally brought forward
against us nowadays,—and, taking the whole country together, I
do not believe the statistics will bear it out.” But why does he
in another place speak of English rural people as “wholesome and
well-to-do,—not specimens of hard, dry, sunburnt muscle, like our
yeoman”? and on still another page: “In America, what squeamishness,
what delicacy, what stomachic apprehension, would there
not be among three stomachs of sixty or seventy years’ experience!
I think this failure of American stomachs is partly owing
to our ill-usage of our digestive powers, partly to our want of
faith in them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe exclaims that “the race of
strong, hardy, cheerful girls ... is daily lessening; and, in their
stead, come the fragile, easy-fatigued, languid girls of a modern
age, drilled in book-learning, ignorant of common things.” Dr.
E. H. Clarke writes in his <cite>Sex and Education</cite>, which should be
read by all parents: “‘I never saw before so many pretty girls
together,’ said Lady Amberley to the writer, after a visit to the
public schools of Boston; and then added, ‘They all looked
sick.’ Circumstances have repeatedly carried me to Europe,
where I am always surprised by the red blood that fills and
colours the faces of ladies and peasant girls, reminding one of
the canvas of Rubens and Murillo; and I am always equally
surprised on my return by crowds of pale, bloodless, female faces,
that suggest consumption, scrofula, anæmia, and neuralgia.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr. S. Weir Mitchell remarks that “To-day the American
woman is, to speak plainly, physically unfit for her duties as
woman.” Dr. Allen, quoted by Sir Lepel Griffin, remarks that a
majority of American women “have a predominance of nerve
tissue, with <em>weak muscles</em> and digestive organs”; and Mr. William
<span class='pageno' id='Page_540'>540</span>Blaikie says that “scarcely one girl in three ventures to wear a
jersey, mainly because she knows too well that this tell-tale jacket
only becomes a good figure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr. Clarke relates that when travelling in the East he was
summoned as a physician into a harem where he had the privilege
of seeing nearly a dozen Syrian girls: “As I looked upon their
well-developed forms, their brown skins, rich with the blood and
sun of the East, and their unintelligent sensuous faces, I thought
that if it were possible to marry the Oriental care of woman’s
organisation to the Western liberty and culture of her brain,
there would be a new birth and loftier type of womanly grace and
form.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There is, doubtless, much truth in these assertions. It is distressing
to see the thin limbs of so many American children, and
the anæmic complexions and frail, willowy forms of so many
maidens. What the American girl chiefly needs is more muscle,
more exercise, more fresh air. A large proportion of girls, it is
true, become invalids because their employers in the shops never
allow them to sit down and rest; and standing, as physiologists
tell us, and as has been proved in the case of armies, is twice as
fatiguing as walking. As if to restore the balance, therefore, the
average well-to-do American girl never walks a hundred yards if a
street car or ’bus is convenient; and the men, too, are not much
better as a rule. One of the most disgusting sights to be seen
in New York on a fine day is a procession of street cars going up
Broadway, crowded to suffocation by young men who have
plenty of time to walk home. In the case of the women, the
cramping French fashions, which impede exercise, are largely to
blame.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fresh-air starvation, again, is almost as epidemic in America as
in Germany. Although night air is less dreaded, draughts are
quite as much; and people imagine that they owe their constant
“colds” to the <em>cold</em> air with which they come into contact, whereas
it is the excessively <em>hot</em> air in their rooms that makes them morbidly
sensitive to a salubrious atmosphere. If young ladies knew that
the hothouse air of their parlours has the same effect on them as
on a bunch of flowers, making them wither prematurely, they
would shun it as they would the sulphurous fumes of a volcano.
Why should they deliberately hasten the conversion of the plump,
smooth grape into a dull, wrinkled raisin?</p>

<p class='c001'>It is through their morbid fondness for hothouse air and their
indolence that American women so often neutralise their natural
advantages: thanks to the fusion of nationalities and the unimpeded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>sway of Romantic Love, they are born more beautiful
than the women of any other nation; but the beauty does not
last.</p>

<p class='c001'>It must be admitted, however, that a vast improvement has
been effected within the last two generations. Beyond all doubt
the young girls of fifteen are to-day healthier and better-looking
than were their mothers at the same age. It is no longer fashionable
to be pale and frail. Anglomania has done some good in
introducing a love of walking, tennis, etc., as well as the habit of
spending a large part of the year in the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Higginson, Mr. R. G. White, and many others, have insisted
on this gradual improvement in the health and physique of
Americans; and Dr. Beard remarks in his work on <cite>American
Nervousness</cite>: “During the last two decades the well-to-do classes
of America have been visibly growing stronger, fuller, healthier.
We weigh more than our fathers; the women in all our great
centres of population are yearly becoming more plump and more
beautiful.... On all sides there is a visible reversion to the
better physical appearance of our English and German ancestors....
The one need for the perfection of the beauty of the American
women—increase of fat—is now supplied.” Yet the one cosmetic
which 20 per cent of American women still need above all others
is the ability to eat food which they scorn as “greasy,” but which
is only greasy when badly prepared. It is to such food that Italian
and Spanish women owe their luscious fulness of figure.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr. Clarke’s work on <cite>Sex and Education</cite> made a great sensation
because he pointed out that the ill-health of American women
is largely due to the brain-work imposed on them at school. Now
the superior beauty of American women is admittedly largely due
to the intelligent animation of their features, to the early training
of their mental faculties. Is this advantage to be sacrificed? Dr.
Clarke’s argument does not point to any such conclusion. He
simply contended that the methods of female education were injurious.
“The law has, or had, a maxim that a man and his wife
are one, and that the one is the man. Modern American education
has a maxim, that boys’ schools and girls’ schools are one,
and that the one is the boys’ school.” Girls need different studies
from boys to fit them for <em>their</em> sphere in life; and above all they
need careful hygienic supervision and periods of rest.—Dr. Clarke’s
book affords many irrefutable arguments in favour of one of the
main theses of the present treatise: that the tendency of civilisation
is to differentiate the sexes, mentally and physically. It is
on this differentiation that the ardour and the cosmetic power of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_542'>542</span>Romantic Love depend. Hence the hopelessness of the Virago
Woman’s Rights Cause, especially in America, where the women
are more thoroughly feminine than elsewhere. It is said that
when the first female presidential candidate announced a lecture
in a western town, <em>not a single auditor</em> appeared on the scene.
American women, evidently, are in no immediate danger of becoming
masculine and ceasing to inspire Love.</p>

<p class='c001'>Women, however, must be educated and thoroughly, for it
has been abundantly shown in the preceding pages that only an
educated mind can feel true Romantic Love. But their education
should be feminine. They need no algebra, Greek, and chemistry.
What they need is first of all a thorough knowledge of Physiology
and Hygiene, so that they may be able to take care of the Health
and Beauty of their children. Then they should be well versed in
literature, so as to be able to shine in conversation. Their artistic
eye should be trained, to enable them to teach their children to go
through the world with their eyes open. Most of us are half
blind; we cannot describe accurately a single person or thing we
see. Music should be taught to all women, as an aid in making
home pleasant and refined, and as an antidote to care. Natural
history is another useful feminine study which enlarges the sympathies
by showing, for example, that birds love and marry almost
as we do, wherefore it is barbarous to wear their stuffed bodies on
one’s hat.</p>

<p class='c001'>Education, Intermarriage, Hygiene, and Romantic Love will
ultimately remove the last traces of the ape and the savage from
the human countenance and figure. Climate will perhaps always
continue to modify different races sufficiently to afford the advantages
of cross-fertilisation or intermarriage. The remarkable
fineness of the American complexion, for instance, has been ascribed
to climatic influences, and with justice it seems, for, according to
Schoolcraft, the skin of the native Indians is not only smoother,
but more delicate and regularly furrowed than that of Europeans.
The notion, however, that the climate is tending to make the
American like the Indian in feature and form is nonsensical. The
typical “Yankee” owes his high cheek-bones and lankness to his
indigestible food; his thin colourless lips to his Puritan ancestry
and lack of æsthetic culture.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even if climate did possess the power to modify the forms of
our features, it would not be allowed to have its own way where
these modifications conflicted with the laws of Beauty. Science is
daily making us more and more independent of crude and cruel
Natural Selection, and of the advantages of physical conformity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_543'>543</span>to our surroundings. Hence Sexual Selection has freer scope to
modify the human race into harmony with æsthetic demands.
Perhaps the time will come when the average man will have as
refined a taste and as deep feelings as a few favoured individuals
have at present; that epoch will be known as the age of Romantic
Love and Personal Beauty.</p>
